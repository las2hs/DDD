36	And are you altogether pleased with Bath?	16	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
37	Yes—I like it very well.	17	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6	It would have been very shocking to have it torn, would not it? It is such a delicate muslin. For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I assure you.	1	3	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
7	How uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here!	2	3	3	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
9	What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here—we seem forcing ourselves into their party.	4	3	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
10	Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large acquaintance here.	5	3	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
11	I wish we had any—it would be somebody to go to.	6	3	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
12	Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly. The Skinners were here last year—I wish they were here now.	7	3	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
13	Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you see.	8	3	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
14	No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had better sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my head, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.	9	3	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
15	No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you must know somebody.	10	3	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
16	I don't, upon my word—I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be so glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an odd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.	11	3	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
8	Yes, my dear, it is very uncomfortable indeed.	3	3	1	replied	with perfect serenity	f	f	f	f
17	Well, Miss Morland, I hope you have had an agreeable ball.	1	4	4	said	directly	f	f	f	f
18	Very agreeable indeed.	2	4	3	replied	vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn	f	f	f	f
19	I wish she had been able to dance; I wish we could have got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had come, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry. I am so sorry she has not had a partner!	3	4	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4	I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will give you this little book on purpose.	1	1	2	\N	\N	t	f	f	f
5	I wish you could dance, my dear—I wish you could get a partner.	1	2	1	saying	\N	t	f	f	f
20	We shall do better another evening I hope.	4	4	4	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
21	I have hitherto been very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have been very negligent—but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars? If you are I will begin directly.	1	5	5	addressed	suddenly	t	f	f	f
22	You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.	2	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
23	No trouble, I assure you, madam.	3	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
24	Have you been long in Bath, madam?	4	5	5	added	with a simpering air	f	f	f	f
25	About a week, sir.	5	5	5	replied	trying not to laugh	f	f	f	f
26	Really!	6	5	5	\N	with affected astonishment	f	f	f	f
27	Why should you be surprised, sir?	7	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
28	Why, indeed! But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed, and not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you never here before, madam?	8	5	5	said	in his natural tone	f	f	f	f
29	Never, sir.	9	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
30	Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?	10	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
31	Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.	11	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
32	Have you been to the theatre?	12	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
33	Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.	13	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
34	To the concert?	14	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
35	Yes, sir, on Wednesday.	15	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
43	If you please.	23	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
38	Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again. I see what you think of me. I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.	18	5	5	said	gravely	f	f	f	f
39	My journal!	19	4	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
40	Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings—plain black shoes—appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.	20	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
41	Indeed I shall say no such thing.	21	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
42	Shall I tell you what you ought to say?	22	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
44	I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had a great deal of conversation with him—seems a most extraordinary genius—hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to say.	24	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
45	But, perhaps, I keep no journal.	25	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
46	Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by you. These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a journal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every evening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered, and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse to a journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies' ways as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.	26	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
47	I have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is—I should not think the superiority was always on our side.	27	5	3	said	doubtingly	f	f	f	f
276	I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.	14	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
352	Yes.	21	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
48	As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three particulars.	28	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
49	And what are they?	29	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
50	A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar.	30	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
51	Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.	31	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
52	I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better landscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.	32	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
53	My dear Catherine, do take this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already; I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though it cost but nine shillings a yard.	33	5	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
54	That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam.	34	5	5	said	looking at the muslin	f	f	f	f
55	Do you understand muslins, sir?	35	5	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
56	Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be an excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown. I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five shillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.	36	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
57	Men commonly take so little notice of those things. I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your sister, sir.	37	5	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
58	I hope I am, madam.	38	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
59	And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?	39	5	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
60	It is very pretty, madam, but I do not think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.	40	5	5	said	gravely examining it	f	f	f	f
61	How can you, be so—	41	5	3	said	laughing	f	f	f	f
62	I am quite of your opinion, sir, and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it.	42	5	1	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
63	But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or a cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sister say so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.	43	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
64	Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We are sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury, but it is so far to go—eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen says it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than eight; and it is such a fag—I come back tired to death. Now, here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.	44	5	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
65	What are you thinking of so earnestly? not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, your meditations are not satisfactory.	45	5	5	said	as they walked back to the ballroom	f	f	f	f
66	I was not thinking of anything.	46	5	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
67	That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me.	47	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
68	Well then, I will not.	48	5	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
69	Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much.	49	5	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
70	What a delightful place Bath is, and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here.	1	6	1	said	as they sat down near the great clock	f	f	f	f
71	I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?	1	7	6	addressed	with great complaisance	t	f	f	f
72	Here come my dear girls. My dear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delighted to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine young woman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is the handsomest.	2	7	6	cried	pointing	f	f	f	f
73	How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is!	3	7	7	observed	aloud	t	f	f	f
74	The very picture of him indeed! I should have known her anywhere for his sister!	4	7	6	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
75	My dear Mr. Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?	1	8	8	said	to him one day	t	f	f	f
76	My dearest creature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at least this age!	1	9	7	address	\N	f	f	f	f
77	Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was in very good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here long?	2	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
78	Oh! These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half hour. But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first place, I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off; it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies! Do you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a shop window in Milsom Street just now—very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all this morning? Have you gone on with Udolpho?	3	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
79	Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the black veil.	4	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
80	Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?	5	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
81	Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me—I would not be told upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina's skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not been to meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.	6	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
82	Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished Udolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.	7	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
83	Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?	8	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
84	I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook. Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries. Those will last us some time.	9	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
196	Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?	4	20	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
85	Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all horrid?	10	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
86	Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read every one of them. I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with her. She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive. I think her as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her! I scold them all amazingly about it.	11	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
87	Scold them! Do you scold them for not admiring her?	12	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
88	Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong. I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us incapable of real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the difference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.	13	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
89	Oh, dear! How can you say so?	14	9	3	cried	colouring	f	f	f	f
90	I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her. Oh! I must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly—I am sure he is in love with you. It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to everybody's admiration, except that of one gentleman, who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you”—speaking more seriously—"your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved object! I can perfectly comprehend your feelings.	15	9	7	laughed	\N	f	f	f	f
91	But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.	16	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
92	Not see him again! My dearest creature, do not talk of it. I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so!	17	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
93	No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if nobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dear Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.	18	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
94	It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.	19	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
95	No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself; but new books do not fall in our way.	20	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
96	Sir Charles Grandison! That is an amazing horrid book, is it not? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.	21	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
97	It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is very entertaining.	22	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
98	Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable. But, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your head tonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you. The men take notice of that sometimes, you know.	23	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
99	But it does not signify if they do.	24	9	3	said	very innocently	f	f	f	f
100	Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say. They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit, and make them keep their distance.	25	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
101	Are they? Well, I never observed that. They always behave very well to me.	26	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
102	Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited creatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance! By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do you like them best dark or fair?	27	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
103	I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, I think. Brown—not fair, and—and not very dark.	28	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
104	Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney—'a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather dark hair.' Well, my taste is different. I prefer light eyes, and as to complexion—do you know—I like a sallow better than any other. You must not betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description.	29	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
105	Betray you! What do you mean?	30	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
106	Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us drop the subject.	31	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
107	For heaven's sake! Let us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They really put me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals. They will hardly follow us there.	32	9	7	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
108	They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I am determined I will not look up.	33	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
109	And which way are they gone? One was a very good-looking young man.	34	9	7	said	turning hastily round	f	f	f	f
110	They went towards the church-yard.	35	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
111	Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say you to going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat? You said you should like to see it.	36	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
112	Only, perhaps we may overtake the two young men.	37	9	3	added	\N	f	f	f	f
113	Oh! Never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them presently, and I am dying to show you my hat.	38	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
114	But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of our seeing them at all.	39	9	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
115	I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have no notion of treating men with such respect. That is the way to spoil them.	40	9	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
116	Oh, these odious gigs! How I detest them.	1	10	7	said	looking up	f	f	f	f
117	Delightful! Mr. Morland and my brother!	2	10	7	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
118	Good heaven! 'Tis James!	3	10	3	uttered	at the same moment	f	f	f	f
119	How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?	1	11	9	\N	\N	t	f	f	f
120	I do not know the distance.	2	11	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
121	Three and twenty! Five and twenty if it is an inch.	3	11	9	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
278	Heyday, Miss Morland! What is the meaning of this? I thought you and I were to dance together.	1	30	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
122	I know it must be five and twenty, by the time we have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of the inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five.	4	11	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
123	You have lost an hour; it was only ten o'clock when we came from Tetbury.	5	11	10	said	\N	t	f	f	f
124	Ten o'clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life? Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible if you can.	6	11	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
125	He does look very hot, to be sure.	7	11	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
126	Hot! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look at his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on. What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it? Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it. I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term: 'Ah! Thorpe,' said he, 'do you happen to want such a little thing as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.' 'Oh! D—,' said I; 'I am your man; what do you ask?' And how much do you think he did, Miss Morland?	8	11	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
127	I am sure I cannot guess at all.	9	11	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
128	Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as new, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage was mine.	10	11	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
129	And I am sure I know so little of such things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.	11	11	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
130	Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.	12	11	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
131	That was very good-natured of you.	13	11	3	said	quite pleased	f	f	f	f
132	Oh! D—— it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful.	14	11	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
133	You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day; Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the time.	1	12	9	renewed	\N	f	f	f	f
134	Yes, but you forget that your horse was included.	2	12	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
135	My horse! Oh, d—— it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?	3	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
136	Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am particularly fond of it.	4	12	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
137	I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.	5	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
138	Thank you.	6	12	3	said	in some distress	f	f	f	f
139	I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.	7	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
140	Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?	8	12	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
141	Rest! He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense; nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon. No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here.	9	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
142	Shall you indeed! That will be forty miles a day.	10	12	3	said	very seriously	f	f	f	f
143	Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown tomorrow; mind, I am engaged.	11	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
144	How delightful that will be! My dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will not have room for a third.	12	12	7	cried	turning round	f	f	f	f
145	A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of you.	13	12	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
146	Have you ever read Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?	1	13	3	ventured	\N	f	f	f	f
147	Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else to do.	2	13	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
148	Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all the others, they are the stupidest things in creation.	3	13	9	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
149	I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very interesting.	4	13	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
150	Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; her novels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature in them.	5	13	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
151	Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe.	6	13	3	said	with some hesitation	f	f	f	f
152	No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about, she who married the French emigrant.	7	13	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
153	I suppose you mean Camilla?	8	13	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
154	Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was sure I should never be able to get through it.	9	13	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
155	I have never read it.	10	13	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
156	You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.	11	13	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
157	Ah, Mother! How do you do? Where did you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch. Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near.	1	14	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
158	Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?	1	15	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
159	I like him very much; he seems very agreeable.	2	15	3	replied	directly	f	f	f	f
160	He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?	3	15	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
161	Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.	4	15	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
162	I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her; and she seems very fond of you. She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you, Catherine,” taking her hand with affection, “may be proud of.	5	15	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
163	Indeed I am; I love her exceedingly, and am delighted to find that you like her too. You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there.	6	15	3	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
164	Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath. She is a most amiable girl; such a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her; she is evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this—is not she?	7	15	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
165	Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath.	8	15	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
166	I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure, are very kind to you?	9	15	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
167	Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me.	10	15	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
168	Indeed, Catherine, I love you dearly.	11	15	10	saying	with perfect sincerity	f	f	f	f
169	I assure you, I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening.	1	16	7	said	\N	f	f	f	f
170	My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out.	2	16	7	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
171	Good-bye, my dear love.	3	16	7	say	\N	f	f	f	f
172	I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.	1	17	1	acknowledged	civilly	f	f	f	f
173	Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it is just the place for young people—and indeed for everybody else too. I tell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health.	2	17	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
174	And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place, from finding it of service to him.	3	17	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
175	Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he will. A neighbour of ours, Dr. Skinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quite stout.	4	17	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
176	That circumstance must give great encouragement.	5	17	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
177	Yes, sir—and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away.	6	17	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
178	I beg your pardon, Miss Morland, for this liberty—but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you.	1	18	11	said	\N	t	f	f	f
179	At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for you this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you knew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you.	1	19	7	exclaimed	in great spirits	f	f	f	f
180	My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could not even see where you were.	2	19	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
181	So I told your brother all the time—but he would not believe me. Do go and see for her, Mr. Morland, said I—but all in vain—he would not stir an inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so immoderately lazy! I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear Catherine, you would be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people.	3	19	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
182	Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head. It is Mr. Tilney's sister.	4	19	3	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
183	Oh! Heavens! You don't say so! Let me look at her this moment. What a delightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is her all-conquering brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me this instant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr. Morland, you are not to listen. We are not talking about you.	5	19	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
184	But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?	6	19	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
185	There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless curiosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! 'Tis nothing. But be satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.	7	19	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
186	And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?	8	19	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
187	Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to you, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you; therefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable.	9	19	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
188	I tell you, Mr. Morland, I would not do such a thing for all the world. How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your brother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, though I tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change partners.	10	19	7	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
189	Upon my honour, in these public assemblies, it is as often done as not.	11	19	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
190	Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry, you never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuade your brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?	12	19	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
191	No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.	13	19	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
192	There, you hear what your sister says, and yet you will not mind her. Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine, for heaven's sake, and stand by me.	14	19	7	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
193	Well, my dear, I hope you have had an agreeable partner.	1	20	6	said	impatient	f	f	f	f
194	Very agreeable, madam.	2	20	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
195	I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he?	3	20	6	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
197	No, where is he?	5	20	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
198	He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about, that he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would ask you, if he met with you.	6	20	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
199	Where can he be?	7	20	3	said	looking round	f	f	f	f
200	Ah! He has got a partner; I wish he had asked you	8	20	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
201	He is a very agreeable young man.	9	20	1	added	\N	f	f	f	f
202	Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen; I must say it, though I am his mother, that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world.	10	20	6	said	smiling complacently	f	f	f	f
203	I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son.	11	20	1	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
204	Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again.	1	21	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
205	Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and, besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.	2	21	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
206	Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this half hour.	3	21	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
207	Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have you been waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into, and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was not it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.	1	22	9	calling	out	f	f	f	f
208	What do you mean? Where are you all going to?	2	22	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
209	Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree together to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We are going up Claverton Down.	3	22	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
210	Something was said about it, I remember; but really I did not expect you.	4	22	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
211	Not expect me! That's a good one! And what a dust you would have made, if I had not come.	5	22	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
212	Well, ma'am, what do you say to it? Can you spare me for an hour or two? Shall I go?	6	22	3	speak	plainer	f	f	f	f
213	Do just as you please, my dear.	7	22	1	replied	with the most placid indifference	f	f	f	f
214	My dearest creature, you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have a thousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to be off.	8	22	7	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
215	What a sweet girl she is! I quite dote on her.	9	22	7	exclaim	aloud	f	f	f	f
216	You will not be frightened, Miss Morland, if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off. He will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest for a minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there is no vice in him.	10	22	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
217	Old Allen is as rich as a Jew—is not he?	1	23	9	saying	very abruptly	f	f	f	f
218	Old Allen, the man you are with.	2	23	9	adding	in explanation	f	f	f	f
219	Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very rich.	3	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
220	And no children at all?	4	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
221	No—not any.	5	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
222	A famous thing for his next heirs. He is your godfather, is not he?	6	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
223	My godfather! No.	7	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
224	But you are always very much with them.	8	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
225	Yes, very much.	9	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
226	Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of old fellow enough, and has lived very well in his time, I dare say; he is not gouty for nothing. Does he drink his bottle a day now?	10	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
227	His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is a very temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?	11	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
228	Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor. Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of this—that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a famous good thing for us all.	12	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
229	I cannot believe it.	13	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
230	Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be. Our foggy climate wants help.	14	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
231	And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford.	15	23	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
232	Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinks there. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way. Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford—and that may account for it. But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.	16	23	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
233	Yes, it does give a notion, and that is, that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, I am sure James does not drink so much.	17	23	3	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
234	You do not really think, Mr. Thorpe, that James's gig will break down?	1	24	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
235	Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least—and as for the body! Upon my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we have got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds.	2	24	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
236	Good heavens! Then pray let us turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do let us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him how very unsafe it is.	3	24	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
277	Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine, but I am really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it is quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you and John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, and come to us. John is just walked off, but he will be back in a moment.	1	29	7	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
350	I do not know indeed.	19	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4691	Oh, cousin!	5	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
279	I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.	2	30	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
237	Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll if it does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent falling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how to drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail.	4	24	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
238	Past three o'clock!	1	25	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
239	Well, my dear, here you are, and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?	1	26	1	greeted	immediately	f	f	f	f
240	Yes, ma'am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.	2	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
241	So Mrs. Thorpe said; she was vastly pleased at your all going.	3	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
242	You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?	4	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
243	Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met her, and we had a great deal of talk together. She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.	5	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
244	Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?	6	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
245	Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.	7	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
246	Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?	8	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
247	Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seem very agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses very handsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.	9	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
248	And what did she tell you of them?	10	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
249	Oh! A vast deal indeed; she hardly talked of anything else.	11	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
250	Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?	12	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
251	Yes, she did; but I cannot recollect now. But they are very good kind of people, and very rich. Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousand pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse.	13	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
252	And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?	14	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
253	Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain. Upon recollection, however, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is; yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put by for her when her mother died.	15	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
254	And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?	16	26	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
255	I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he is; but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likely to do very well.	17	26	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
256	Oh, heavens! My beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?	1	27	7	address	\N	f	f	f	f
257	Now, Mr. Morland, I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it. My sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney—but that is a settled thing—even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him! I really am quite wild with impatience. My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce him to me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven's sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.	2	27	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
258	No, he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.	3	27	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
259	Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him? How do you like my gown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.	4	27	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
260	No, indeed I should not.	5	27	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
261	Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. You would have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by for the world.	6	27	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
262	Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my head.	7	27	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
263	How well your brother dances!	1	28	3	exclamation	artless	f	f	f	f
264	Henry! Yes, he does dance very well.	2	28	12	replied	with a smile	t	f	f	f
265	He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening, when he saw me sitting down. But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe.	3	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
266	You cannot think, how surprised I was to see him again. I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.	4	28	3	added	after a moment's silence	f	f	f	f
267	When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but for a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us.	5	28	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
268	That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I thought he must be gone. Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith?	6	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
269	Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.	7	28	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
270	I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think her pretty?	8	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
271	Not very.	9	28	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
272	He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?	10	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
273	Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father.	11	28	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
274	I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon. Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?	12	28	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
275	Perhaps we—Yes, I think we certainly shall.	13	28	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
280	That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake of dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and when they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz me famously.	3	30	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
281	Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that.	4	30	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
282	By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for blockheads. What chap have you there?	5	30	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
283	Tilney. Hum—I do not know him. A good figure of a man; well put together. Does he want a horse? Here is a friend of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A famous clever animal for the road—only forty guineas. I had fifty minds to buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not do for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I have three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take eight hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire, against the next season. It is so d—uncomfortable, living at an inn.	6	30	9	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
284	That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with you half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other. I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours.	1	31	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
285	But they are such very different things!	2	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
286	—That you think they cannot be compared together.	3	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
287	To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour.	4	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
288	And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could place them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours, or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else. You will allow all this?	5	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
289	Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still they are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the same light, nor think the same duties belong to them.	6	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
290	In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.	7	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
291	No, indeed, I never thought of that.	8	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
292	Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This disposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to address you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose?	9	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
293	Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if he talks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with.” "And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!	10	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
294	And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!	11	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
295	Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody, it is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody.	12	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
296	Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed with courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before?	13	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
297	Yes, quite—more so, indeed.	14	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
298	More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.	15	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
299	I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.	16	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
300	Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds out every year. 'For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.' You would be told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer.	17	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
301	Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retired village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know nothing of there.	18	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
302	You are not fond of the country.	19	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
305	Do I?	22	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
304	But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.	21	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
349	Not they indeed; for, as we turned into Broad Street, I saw them—does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?	18	35	9	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
351	Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking of the man you danced with last night, are not you?	20	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3910	Certainly.	4	400	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
353	Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a smart-looking girl.	22	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
303	Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life. One day in the country is exactly like another.	20	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
306	Do you not?	23	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
307	I do not believe there is much difference.	24	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
308	Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.	25	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
309	And so I am at home—only I do not find so much of it. I walk about here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.	26	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
310	Only go and call on Mrs. Allen! What a picture of intellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you will have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that you did here.	27	31	5	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
311	Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath, when I am at home again—I do like it so very much. If I could but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be too happy! James's coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful—and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be tired of Bath?	28	31	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
312	Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do. But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath—and the honest relish of balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.”	29	31	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
313	vI see that you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name, and you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my father.	1	32	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
314	Oh!	2	32	3	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
315	I shall like it, beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it off—let us go tomorrow.	1	33	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
316	Remember—twelve o'clock.	2	33	3	speech	parting	f	f	f	f
317	She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the clouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.	1	34	1	opinion	positive	f	f	f	f
318	Oh! dear, I do believe it will be wet.	2	34	3	broke	in a most desponding tone	f	f	f	f
319	I thought how it would be.	3	34	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
320	No walk for me today; but perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before twelve.	4	34	3	sighed	\N	f	f	f	f
321	Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.	5	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
322	Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.	6	34	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
323	No, I know you never mind dirt.	7	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
324	It comes on faster and faster!	8	34	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
325	So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.	9	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
326	There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an umbrella!	10	34	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
327	They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chair at any time.	11	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
328	It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would be dry!	12	34	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
329	Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in the pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.	13	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
330	You will not be able to go, my dear.	14	34	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
331	I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!—the night that poor St. Aubin died!—such beautiful weather!	15	34	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
332	Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for me perhaps—but I shall not go—I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss Tilney may still call.	1	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
333	Make haste! Make haste! Put on your hat this moment—there is no time to be lost—we are going to Bristol. How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?	2	35	9	calling	out	f	f	f	f
334	To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go with you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.	3	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
335	My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? We shall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain. But it does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it, go on to Kingsweston.	4	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
336	I doubt our being able to do so much.	5	35	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
337	You croaking fellow! We shall be able to do ten times more. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can hear of; but here is your sister says she will not go.	6	35	9	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
338	Blaize Castle! What is that?	7	35	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
339	The finest place in England—worth going fifty miles at any time to see.	8	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
340	What, is it really a castle, an old castle?	9	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
341	The oldest in the kingdom.	10	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
342	But is it like what one reads of?	11	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
343	Exactly—the very same.	12	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
344	But now really—are there towers and long galleries?	13	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
345	By dozens.	14	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
346	Then I should like to see it; but I cannot—I cannot go.	15	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
347	Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?	16	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
348	I cannot go, because—I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now, as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.	17	35	3	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
354	Did you indeed?	23	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
355	Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too.	24	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
356	It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk.	25	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
357	And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk! You could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the whole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.	26	35	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
358	My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an idea of the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.	27	35	7	corroborated	\N	f	f	f	f
359	I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we go up every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?	28	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
360	Yes, yes, every hole and corner.	29	35	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
362	Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were going as far as Wick Rocks.	31	35	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
361	But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer, and call by and by?	30	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
363	Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?	32	35	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
364	Just as you please, my dear.	33	35	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
365	Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go.	34	35	13	cry	general	f	f	f	f
366	Well, my dear, suppose you go.	35	35	1	said	\N	f	f	f	f
367	Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?	1	36	9	address	\N	f	f	f	f
368	Who? Where?	2	36	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
369	On the right-hand pavement—she must be almost out of sight now.	3	36	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
370	Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe; it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them.	4	36	3	cried	impatiently	f	f	f	f
371	Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney.	5	36	3	entreated	\N	f	f	f	f
372	How could you deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?	6	36	3	reproaches	\N	f	f	f	f
373	We had better go back, Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much better put it off till another day, and turn round.	1	37	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
374	It is all one to me.	2	37	9	replied	rather angrily	f	f	f	f
375	If your brother had not got such a d—beast to drive, we might have done it very well. My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded jade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own.	3	37	9	said	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
376	No, he is not, for I am sure he could not afford it.	4	37	3	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
377	And why cannot he afford it?	5	37	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
378	Because he has not money enough.	6	37	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
379	And whose fault is that?	7	37	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
380	Nobody's, that I know of.	8	37	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
381	I am glad your brother had so much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme.	9	37	4	said	\N	f	f	f	f
382	How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ball or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such consequence.	1	38	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
383	Do not be so dull, my dearest creature. You will quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual? It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I should not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same; he has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you have got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fifty times rather you should have them than myself.	2	38	7	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
384	Mrs. Allen, will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything.	1	39	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
385	Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney always wears white.	2	39	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
386	Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been quite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have thought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?	1	40	3	answered	not with such calmness	f	f	f	f
387	My dear, you tumble my gown.	2	40	1	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
388	We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back on purpose.	3	40	5	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
389	But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not—Oh! You were not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run after you.	4	40	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
390	Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was not angry, because I know she was; for she would not see me this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted. Perhaps you did not know I had been there.	5	40	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
528	I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.	4	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
535	And must I go?	11	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
791	Errand! To me!	2	83	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
391	I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more than that my father—they were just preparing to walk out, and he being hurried for time, and not caring to have it put off—made a point of her being denied. That was all, I do assure you. She was very much vexed, and meant to make her apology as soon as possible.	6	40	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
392	But, Mr. Tilney, why were you less generous than your sister? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take offence?	7	40	3	question	\N	f	f	f	f
393	Me! I take offence!	8	40	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
394	Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were angry.	9	40	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
395	I angry! I could have no right.	10	40	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
396	Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.	11	40	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
397	How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father?	1	41	3	inquiry	anxious	f	f	f	f
398	He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout, active—looks as young as his son. I have a great regard for him, I assure you: a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.	1	42	9	asking	in a consequential manner	f	f	f	f
399	But how came you to know him?	2	42	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
400	Know him! There are few people much about town that I do not know. I have met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard-room. One of the best players we have, by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almost afraid of him at first: the odds were five to four against me; and, if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world—I took his ball exactly—but I could not make you understand it without a table; however, I did beat him. A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew. I should like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famous dinners. But what do you think we have been talking of? You. Yes, by heavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.	3	42	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
401	Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?	4	42	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
402	And what do you think I said? well done, general, said I; I am quite of your mind.	5	42	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
403	Do not urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go.	1	43	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
404	It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday.	2	43	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
405	No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior engagement.	3	43	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
406	I cannot help being jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not in the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.	4	43	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
407	Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out any longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend—I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.	5	43	10	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
408	No, no, no! that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday.	6	43	10	answer	immediately	f	f	f	f
409	Very well, then there is an end of the party. If Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.	7	43	7	said	in a voice of cold resentment	f	f	f	f
410	Catherine, you must go.	7	43	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
411	But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters? I dare say either of them would like to go.	9	43	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
412	Thank ye, but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d—— me if I do. I only go for the sake of driving you.	10	43	9	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
413	That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.	11	43	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
414	"I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine; you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest, best-tempered of my sisters.”	12	43	10	said	\N	f	f	f	f
415	I hope I am not less so now; but indeed I cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.	13	43	3	replied	very feelingly	f	f	f	f
416	I suspect there is no great struggle.	14	43	7	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
417	Well, I have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.	1	44	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
418	You have not!	2	44	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
419	I have, upon my soul. Left her this moment. Told her you had sent me to say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday. She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her; so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of mine—hey?	3	44	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
420	A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a most delightful party.	4	44	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
421	This will not do; I cannot submit to this. I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right.	5	44	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
422	I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message. If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has—He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe; Isabella, do not hold me.	6	44	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
423	Then I will go after them; wherever they are I will go after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.	7	44	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
424	Let her go, let her go, if she will go.	8	44	10	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
425	She is as obstinate as—	9	44	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
426	I am come in a great hurry—It was all a mistake—I never promised to go—I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant.	1	45	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
427	Well, and do you think of going too?	1	46	4	said	\N	f	f	f	f
428	No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?	2	46	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
429	No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes are not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?	3	46	4	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
430	Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean gown is not five minutes' wear in them. You are splashed getting in and getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction. I hate an open carriage myself.	4	46	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
431	I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has an odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men, to whom they are not even related?	5	46	4	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
432	Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.	6	46	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
433	Dear madam, then why did not you tell me so before? I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought I was doing wrong.	7	46	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
434	And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But one must not be over particular. Young people will be young people, as your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do not like to be always thwarted.	8	46	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
435	But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade.	9	46	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
436	As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done; and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more.	10	46	4	said	\N	f	f	f	f
437	That is just what I was going to say.	11	46	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
438	You had better leave her alone, my dear; she is old enough to know what she is about, and if not, has a mother to advise her. Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you had better not interfere. She and your brother choose to go, and you will be only getting ill will.	12	46	4	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
439	I never look at it, without thinking of the south of France.	1	47	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
440	You have been abroad then?	2	47	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
441	Oh! No, I only mean what I have read about. It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through, in The Mysteries of Udolpho. But you never read novels, I dare say?	3	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
442	Why not?	4	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
443	Because they are not clever enough for you—gentlemen read better books.	5	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
444	The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid. I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho, when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember finishing it in two days—my hair standing on end the whole time.	6	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
445	Yes, and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.	7	47	12	added	\N	f	f	f	f
446	Thank you, Eleanor—a most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland, the injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are to observe, was her own, particularly her own. I am proud when I reflect on it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.	8	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
447	I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself. But I really thought before, young men despised novels amazingly.	9	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
448	It is amazingly; it may well suggest amazement if they do—for they read nearly as many as women. I myself have read hundreds and hundreds. Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas. If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasing inquiry of 'Have you read this?' and 'Have you read that?' I shall soon leave you as far behind me as—what shall I say?—I want an appropriate simile.—as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy. Consider how many years I have had the start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home!	10	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
449	Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world?	11	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
450	The nicest—by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend upon the binding.	12	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
451	Henry, you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he is treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever finding fault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking the same liberty with you. The word 'nicest,' as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.	13	47	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
452	I am sure I did not mean to say anything wrong; but it is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?	14	47	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
529	How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dear Catherine; indeed he is unworthy of you.	5	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
532	But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy.	8	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
536	Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled.	12	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
538	Your brother will not mind it, I know, because I heard him say before that he hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him to think of it. I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she might wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would not dance upon any account in the world.	1	55	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
541	With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person's feelings, age, situation, and probable habits of life considered—but, How should I be influenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?	4	55	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
544	Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.	7	55	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4930	Certainly.	14	504	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
453	Very true, and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement—people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or their choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word.	15	47	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
454	While, in fact, it ought only to be applied to you, without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come, Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that kind of reading?	16	47	12	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
456	Indeed!	18	47	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
458	Yes, I am fond of history.	20	47	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
455	To say the truth, I do not much like any other.	17	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
457	That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and do not dislike travels. But history, real solemn history, I cannot be interested in. Can you?	19	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
459	I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all—it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs—the chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other books.	21	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
460	Historians, you think, are not happy in their flights of fancy. They display imagination without raising interest. I am fond of history—and am very well contented to take the false with the true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records, which may be as much depended on, I conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one's own observation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they are embellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn up, I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made—and probably with much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than if the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.	22	47	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
461	You are fond of history! And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it. So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable! At this rate, I shall not pity the writers of history any longer. If people like to read their books, it is all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes, which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look into, to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls, always struck me as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and necessary, I have often wondered at the person's courage that could sit down on purpose to do it.	23	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
462	That little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life. I use the verb 'to torment,' as I observed to be your own method, instead of 'to instruct,' supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous.	24	47	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
463	You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home, you would allow that 'to torment' and 'to instruct' might sometimes be used as synonymous words.	25	47	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
464	Very probably. But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to be tormented for two or three years of one's life, for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it. Consider—if reading had not been taught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain—or perhaps might not have written at all.	26	47	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
465	I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London.	1	48	3	uttered	\N	f	f	f	f
466	Indeed! And of what nature?	2	48	12	replied	hastily	f	f	f	f
467	That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.	3	48	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
468	Good heaven! Where could you hear of such a thing?	4	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
469	A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect murder and everything of the kind.	5	48	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
470	You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend's accounts have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect.	6	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
471	Government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; and government cares not how much.	7	48	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
530	Unworthy! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me.	6	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
533	Oh! I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him of pride. I believe he is a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him, and John's judgment—	9	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
537	Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. But do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will be some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg; that is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me to death, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short. Ten to one but he guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.	13	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
539	How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people's actions.	2	55	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
542	I do not understand you.	5	55	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
545	Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language.	8	55	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
547	Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of the consequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and certainly bring on a disagreement between us.	10	55	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
681	To be sure you must miss him very much.	14	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
688	Yes, entirely.	3	70	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
472	Come, shall I make you understand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can? No—I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours. Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute—neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want observation, discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.	8	48	5	added	\N	f	f	f	f
473	Miss Morland, do not mind what he says; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot.	9	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
474	Riot! What riot?	10	48	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
475	My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusion there is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern—do you understand? And you, Miss Morland—my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London—and instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have done, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means a simpleton in general.	11	48	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
476	And now, Henry, that you have made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself—unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in general. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.	12	48	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
477	I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.	13	48	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
478	No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.	14	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
479	What am I to do?	15	48	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
480	You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely before her. Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women.	16	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
481	Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world—especially of those—whoever they may be—with whom I happen to be in company.	17	48	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
482	That is not enough. Be more serious.	18	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
483	Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half.	19	48	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
484	We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland. He is not in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all, or an unkind one of me.	20	48	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
485	They set off at eight this morning, and I am sure I do not envy them their drive. I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape. It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year. Belle went with your brother, and John drove Maria.	1	49	14	said	\N	t	f	f	f
486	Oh! yes, Maria is gone. She was quite wild to go. She thought it would be something very fine. I cannot say I admire her taste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go, if they pressed me ever so much.	2	49	14	rejoined	\N	f	f	f	f
487	I wish you could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go.	3	49	3	answering	\N	f	f	f	f
488	Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me. Indeed, I would not have gone on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us.	4	49	14	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
490	Yes, my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceived you. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.	2	50	7	began	\N	f	f	f	f
489	She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help it? John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because she had such thick ankles. I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper.	1	50	15	\N	\N	t	f	f	f
491	Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend, compose yourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and talk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note? Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming of men. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will your excellent father and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them I am so agitated!	3	50	7	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
492	Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can you—can you really be in love with James?	4	50	3	cried	out	f	f	f	f
493	You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my Catherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own.	1	51	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
494	You are so like your dear brother that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me; the first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas—the very first moment I beheld him—my heart was irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John introduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.	2	51	7	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
531	That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you. Such fickleness! Oh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John has the most constant heart.	7	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
534	Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet them at the rooms.	10	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
540	Why? What do you mean?	3	55	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
543	Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly well.	6	55	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
546	But pray tell me what you mean.	9	55	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
548	No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.	11	55	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
677	I used to walk here so often with her! though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now.	10	69	12	added	\N	f	f	f	f
689	And how long ago may it be that your mother died?	4	70	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5522	Yes.	26	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
495	I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore her puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a wink all right for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother's account! I would not have you suffer half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it. I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually—so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would be safe with you.	3	51	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
496	It is impossible for parents to be more kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately.	4	51	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
497	Morland says exactly the same; and yet I dare not expect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it. Your brother, who might marry anybody!	5	51	7	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
498	Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify.	6	51	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
499	Oh! My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I the command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brother would be my only choice.	7	51	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
500	I am sure they will consent; I am sure they will be delighted with you.	8	51	3	declaration	frequent	f	f	f	f
501	For my own part, my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are really attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would not settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about Richmond.	9	51	7	said	\N	f	f	f	f
502	Richmond! You must settle near Fullerton. You must be near us.	10	51	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
503	I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near you, I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow myself to think of such things, till we have your father's answer. Morland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow. Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I know it will be the death of me.	11	51	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
504	Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how far you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven's sake, waste no more time. There, go, go—I insist on it.	1	52	9	called	\N	f	f	f	f
505	Well, Miss Morland, I am come to bid you good-bye.	1	53	9	said	\N	f	f	f	f
506	Shall not you be late at Devizes?	2	53	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
507	A famous good thing this marrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's. What do you think of it, Miss Morland? I say it is no bad notion.	3	53	9	burst out	\N	f	f	f	f
508	I am sure I think it a very good one.	4	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
509	Do you? That's honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One Wedding Brings on Another?' I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope.	5	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
510	Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible.	6	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
511	And then you know—I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old song.	7	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
512	May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with Miss Tilney today, and must now be going home.	8	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
513	Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may be together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.	9	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
514	Then why do you stay away so long?	10	53	3	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
515	That is kind of you, however—kind and good-natured. I shall not forget it in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody living, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you have such—upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.	11	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
516	Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a great deal better. Good morning to you.	12	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
517	But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long, if not disagreeable.	13	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
518	Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you.	14	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
519	And I hope—I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me.	15	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
520	Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see. Company is always cheerful.	16	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
521	That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful company, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters.	17	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
522	Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to most matters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind about.	18	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
523	By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only have the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and what care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good income of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better.	19	53	9	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
524	Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one side, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which has it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton, whenever it is convenient.	20	53	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
525	It was all pride, pride, insufferable haughtiness and pride! She had long suspected the family to be very high, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney's she had never heard of in her life! Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with such superciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!	1	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
526	But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness; she was very civil.	2	54	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
527	Oh! Don't defend her! And then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people's feelings are incomprehensible. And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?	3	54	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
549	Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother's wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.	12	55	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
550	I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not to dance.	1	56	3	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
551	And did Isabella never change her mind before?	2	56	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
552	Oh! But, because—And your brother! After what you told him from me, how could he think of going to ask her?	3	56	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
553	I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprised on your friend's account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother, his conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an open attraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by yourself.	4	56	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
554	You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.	5	56	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
555	It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must be to be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment; and, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.	6	56	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
556	I do not wonder at your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He is such a rattle! Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have given the world to sit still.	1	57	7	explained	\N	f	f	f	f
557	Then why did not you?	2	57	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
558	Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how I abhor doing that. I refused him as long as I possibly could, but he would take no denial. You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged him to excuse me, and get some other partner—but no, not he; after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with me. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches and compliments; and so—and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him, might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am so glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was upon us.	3	57	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
559	He is very handsome indeed.	4	57	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
560	Handsome! Yes, I suppose he may. I dare say people would admire him in general; but he is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he is very well. Amazingly conceited, I am sure. I took him down several times, you know, in my way.	5	57	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
561	It is very charming indeed.	1	58	7	said	\N	f	f	f	f
562	Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed. I only wish I could do as much. One could not expect more from him, you know. If he finds he can do more by and by, I dare say he will, for I am sure he must be an excellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you do not consider how little you ever want, my dear.	2	58	6	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
563	It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. For myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.	3	58	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
564	I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child—but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome, you know. I always heard he was a most excellent man; and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a suitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I am sure he must be a most liberal-minded man.	4	58	6	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
569	By the end of another week!	1	59	3	echoed	\N	f	f	f	f
565	Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. But everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money.	5	58	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
566	I am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford.	6	58	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
567	As to that, my sweet Catherine, there cannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should not have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out. There's the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living.	7	58	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
568	Yes, yes, my darling Isabella, we perfectly see into your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand the present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection.	8	58	6	said	\N	f	f	f	f
570	Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial. He has been disappointed of some friends' arrival whom he expected to meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in a hurry to get home.	2	59	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
571	I am very sorry for it; if I had known this before—	3	59	3	said	dejectedly	f	f	f	f
572	Perhaps you would be so good—it would make me very happy if—	4	59	12	said	in an embarrassed manner	f	f	f	f
573	Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend?	5	59	16	said	\N	t	f	f	f
574	I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.	6	59	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
595	Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further. John desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have. But I confess, as soon as I read his letter, I thought it a very foolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good of either; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together? You have both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say, there is no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it; he could not have received my last.	18	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
678	And ought it not, to endear it to her husband? Yet the general would not enter it.	11	69	3	reflected	\N	f	f	f	f
682	A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a constant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other.	15	69	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
575	Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. My daughter, Miss Morland, has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as she has perhaps told you, on Saturday se'nnight. A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of my very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And could we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without a single regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire? I am almost ashamed to make the request, though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself. Modesty such as yours—but not for the world would I pain it by open praise. If you can be induced to honour us with a visit, you will make us happy beyond expression. 'Tis true, we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain and unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.	7	59	16	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
576	I will write home directly, and if they do not object, as I dare say they will not—	8	59	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
577	Since they can consent to part with you, we may expect philosophy from all the world.	9	59	16	said	\N	f	f	f	f
578	This is my favourite place; it is so out of the way.	1	60	7	said	\N	f	f	f	f
579	Do not be uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.	2	60	3	said	gaily	f	f	f	f
580	Psha! My dear creature, do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow. It would be hideous to be always together; we should be the jest of the place. And so you are going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is one of the finest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend upon a most particular description of it.	3	60	7	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
581	You shall certainly have the best in my power to give. But who are you looking for? Are your sisters coming?	4	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
582	I am not looking for anybody. One's eyes must be somewhere, and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are an hundred miles off. I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp.	5	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
583	But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?	6	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
584	Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My poor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from John; you can guess the contents.	7	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
585	No, indeed, I cannot.	8	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
586	My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he write about, but yourself? You know he is over head and ears in love with you.	9	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
587	With me, dear Isabella!	10	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
588	Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and all that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained! It is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such as a child must have noticed. And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement. He says so in this letter, says that he as good as made you an offer, and that you received his advances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge his suit, and say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain to affect ignorance.	11	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
589	As to any attentions on his side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for a moment—except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming. And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be some unaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last half hour before he went away! It must be all and completely a mistake—for I did not see him once that whole morning.	12	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
590	But that you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in Edgar's Buildings—it was the day your father's consent came—and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house.	13	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
591	Are you? Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say—but for the life of me, I cannot recollect it. I do remember now being with you, and seeing him as well as the rest—but that we were ever alone for five minutes—However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass on his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it, that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind from him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me—but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had the smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and tell him I beg his pardon—that is—I do not know what I ought to say—but make him understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—he is not the person.	14	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
592	My dear friend, you must not be angry with me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me. And, you know, we shall still be sisters.	15	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
593	Yes, yes, there are more ways than one of our being sisters. But where am I wandering to? Well, my dear Catherine, the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John—is not it so?	16	60	7	\N	(with a blush)	f	f	f	f
594	I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meant to encourage it.	17	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
596	You do acquit me, then, of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me till this moment?	19	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
674	This is so favourite a walk of mine, that I always think it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.	7	69	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
679	Her death must have been a great affliction!	11	69	3	ventured	\N	f	f	f	f
683	Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any picture of her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was it from dejection of spirits?	16	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
685	No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place. Soon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my bed-chamber—where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.	18	69	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
690	She has been dead these nine years.	5	70	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3117	Whom are you going to dance with?	11	330	49	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
597	Oh! As to that, I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been. All that is best known to yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so will occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely. All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you know, one may not mean the next. Circumstances change, opinions alter.	20	60	7	answered	laughingly	f	f	f	f
598	But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the same. You are describing what never happened.	21	60	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
599	My dearest Catherine, I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about. I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother, because he is my brother, and who perhaps after all, you know, might be just as happy without you, for people seldom know what they would be at, young men especially, they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant. What I say is, why should a brother's happiness be dearer to me than a friend's? You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my dear Catherine, do not be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections, and I believe he is very right. Ah! Here he comes; never mind, he will not see us, I am sure.	22	60	7	continued	without at all listening to her	f	f	f	f
600	What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!	23	60	17	spoken	low	f	f	f	f
601	Psha, nonsense! Why do you put such things into my head? If I could believe it—my spirit, you know, is pretty independent.	24	60	7	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
602	I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.	25	60	17	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
603	My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men have none of you any hearts.	26	60	7	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
604	If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.	27	60	17	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
605	Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you; I hope your eyes are not tormented now.	28	60	7	\N	(turning her back on him)	f	f	f	f
606	Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view—at once too much and too little.	29	60	17	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
607	My brother does know it.	1	61	5	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
608	Does he? Then why does he stay here?	2	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
609	Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longer he stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his own sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will in time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and it is only staying to be miserable.	3	61	3	continued	eagerly	f	f	f	f
610	I am sure my brother would not wish to do that.	4	61	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
611	Then you will persuade him to go away?	5	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
612	Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour to persuade him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. He knows what he is about, and must be his own master.	6	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
613	No, he does not know what he is about; he does not know the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told me so, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.	7	61	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
614	And are you sure it is my brother's doing?	8	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
615	Yes, very sure.	9	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
616	Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe's admission of them, that gives the pain?	10	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
617	Is not it the same thing?	11	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
618	I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended by another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.	12	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
619	Isabella is wrong. But I am sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my brother. She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and while my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into a fever. You know she must be attached to him.	13	61	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
620	I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.	14	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
621	Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another.	15	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
622	It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so well, as she might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a little.	16	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
623	Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother?	17	61	3	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
624	I can have no opinion on that subject.	18	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
625	But what can your brother mean? If he knows her engagement, what can he mean by his behaviour?	19	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
626	You are a very close questioner.	20	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
627	Am I? I only ask what I want to be told.	21	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
628	But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?	22	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
629	Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart.	23	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
630	My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure you I can only guess at.	24	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
631	Well?	25	61	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
632	Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves. To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are before you. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her.	26	61	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
633	Well, you may be able to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak to him, he would go.	27	61	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
675	The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course.	8	69	16	excused	\N	f	f	f	f
684	Her picture, I suppose, hangs in your father's room?	17	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
686	I was going to take you into what was my mother's room—the room in which she died—	1	70	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
691	You were with her, I suppose, to the last?	6	70	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
693	My father, often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual.	8	70	12	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
634	My dear Miss Morland, in this amiable solicitude for your brother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this—and you may be sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, 'Do not be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.	28	61	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
635	Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of absence will soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what will then be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney's passion for a month.	29	61	5	added	\N	f	f	f	f
636	How glad I shall be when you are all off.	1	62	17	whisper	\N	f	f	f	f
637	But how can that be? Are not you with her?	1	63	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
638	Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father's, and some of my time is necessarily spent there.	2	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
639	How sorry you must be for that!	3	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
640	I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.	4	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
642	You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey.	6	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
643	To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one reads about?	7	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
644	And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as 'what one reads about' may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry?	8	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
641	Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of the abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must be very disagreeable.	5	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
645	Oh! yes—I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there would be so many people in the house—and besides, it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.	9	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
646	No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire—nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber—too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size—its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?	10	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
647	Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.	11	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
648	How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance, gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints. To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this parting cordial she curtsies off—you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you—and when, with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover, with increased alarm, that it has no lock.	12	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
649	Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot really happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy. Well, what then?	13	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
650	Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains—and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think you discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection, and on opening it, a door will immediately appear—which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening—and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room.	14	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
651	No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.	15	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
676	I am particularly fond of this spot. It was my mother's favourite walk.	9	69	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
680	A great and increasing one. I was only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then know what a loss it was.” She stopped for a moment, and then added, with great firmness, "I have no sister, you know—and though Henry—though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.	13	69	12	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
687	It remains as it was, I suppose?	2	70	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
692	No; I was unfortunately from home. Her illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.	7	70	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
652	What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room, and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into every drawer—but for some time without discovering anything of importance—perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will open—a roll of paper appears—you seize it—it contains many sheets of manuscript—you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou—whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall'—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in total darkness.	16	63	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
653	Oh! No, no—do not say so. Well, go on.	17	63	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
654	That is a curious old chest, is not it? It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at least out of the way.	1	64	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
655	that she must have been used to much better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?	1	65	16	supposed	\N	f	f	f	f
656	No, indeed; Mr. Allen's dining-parlour was not more than half as large.	2	65	3	assurance	honest	f	f	f	f
657	But we have a charming morning after it; and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautiful hyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.	1	66	3	added	\N	f	f	f	f
658	And how might you learn? By accident or argument?	2	66	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
659	Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent about flowers.	3	66	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
660	But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a new source of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?	4	66	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
661	But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never within.	5	66	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
662	At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction?	6	66	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
663	This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother's fortitude. Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today.	1	67	16	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
664	Is it a pretty place?	2	67	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
665	What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not be ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing. Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his profession.	3	67	16	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
666	But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object. The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she prefer? He was equally at her service. Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend's wishes? But he thought he could discern. Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather. But when did she judge amiss? The abbey would be always safe and dry. He yielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment.	1	68	16	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
667	I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father's account; he always walks out at this time of day.	2	68	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
668	without any ambition of that sort himself—without any solicitude about it—he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he had a hobby-horse, it was that. He loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he loved good fruit—or if he did not, his friends and children did. There were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his. The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits. The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he supposed, must feel these inconveniences as well as himself.	1	69	16	owned	modestly	f	f	f	f
669	No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never went into it.	2	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
670	How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?	3	69	16	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
671	Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.	4	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
672	He is a happy man!	5	69	16	said	\N	f	f	f	f
673	But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland will get wet. Our best way is across the park.	6	69	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5552	No, sir.	5	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
694	I have many pamphlets to finish, before I can close my eyes, and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will be blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future mischief.	1	71	16	said	\N	f	f	f	f
695	My father only wanted me to answer a note.	1	72	12	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
696	Mr. Tilney!	1	73	3	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
697	Good God! How came you here? How came you up that staircase?	2	73	3	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
698	How came I up that staircase! Because it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why should I not come up it?	3	73	5	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
699	And may I not, in my turn, ask how you came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the stables to mine.	4	73	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
700	I have been to see your mother's room.	5	73	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
701	My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?	6	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
702	No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow.	7	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
703	I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You look pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs. Perhaps you did not know—you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use?	8	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
704	No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride.	9	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
705	Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself?	10	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
706	Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday—and we were coming here to these rooms—but only”—dropping her voice—"your father was with us.	11	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
707	And that prevented you. Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage?	12	73	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
708	No, I only wanted to see—Is not it very late? I must go and dress.	13	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
709	It is only a quarter past four—and you are not now in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger must be enough.	14	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
710	Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?	15	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
711	No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly.	16	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
712	Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise—the fidelity of promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can deceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not? Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sent you to look at it, I suppose?	17	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
713	No.	18	73	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
714	It has been your own doing entirely?	19	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
715	As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character, as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose, has talked of her a great deal?	20	73	5	added	\N	f	f	f	f
716	Yes, a great deal. That is—no, not much, but what she did say was very interesting. Her dying so suddenly, and you—none of you being at home—and your father, I thought—perhaps had not been very fond of her.	21	73	3	spoken	slowly, and with much hesitation	f	f	f	f
717	And from these circumstances, you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence—some—or it may be—of something still less pardonable.	22	73	5	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
718	My mother's illness, the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden. The malady itself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever—its cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon as she could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectable man, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon his opinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On the fifth day she died. During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I (we were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin.	23	73	5	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
719	But your father, was he afflicted?	24	73	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
720	For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attached to her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him to—we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition—and I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never did. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly afflicted by her death.	25	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
721	I am very glad of it; it would have been very shocking!	26	73	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
722	If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to—Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?	27	73	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
723	Tis only from James, however.	1	74	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
724	No bad news from Fullerton, I hope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland—your brothers and sisters—I hope they are none of them ill?	1	75	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
725	No, I thank you; they are all very well. My letter was from my brother at Oxford.	2	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
726	I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again!	3	75	3	added	\N	f	f	f	f
727	I am sorry; if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have given it with very different feelings.	4	75	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
728	It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James is so unhappy! You will soon know why.	5	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
729	To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress.	6	75	5	replied	warmly	f	f	f	f
730	I have one favour to beg, that, if your brother should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that I may go away.”	7	75	3	said	in an agitated manner	f	f	f	f
731	Our brother! Frederick!	8	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
732	Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney.	9	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
733	How quick you are!: you have guessed it, I declare! And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its ending so. Isabella—no wonder now I have not heard from her—Isabella has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is bad in the world?	10	75	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
734	I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland's disappointment. His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you must be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland—sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick's marrying her than at any other part of the story.	11	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
735	It is very true, however; you shall read James's letter yourself. Stay—There is one part—	12	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
736	Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother?	13	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
737	No, read it yourself. I do not know what I was thinking of; James only means to give me good advice.	14	75	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
738	Well, if it is to be so, I can only say that I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected. I do not envy his situation, either as a lover or a son.	15	75	5	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
739	Her mother is a very good sort of woman.	16	75	3	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
740	What was her father?	17	75	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
741	A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.	18	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
742	Are they a wealthy family?	19	75	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
743	No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children.	20	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
744	But, would it be to promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must be an unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so. And how strange an infatuation on Frederick's side! A girl who, before his eyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Is not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his heart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!	21	75	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
745	That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption against him. When I think of his past declarations, I give him up. Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He is a deceased man—defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor, and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless, guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions, and knowing no disguise.	22	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
746	Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in.	23	75	12	said	\N	f	f	f	f
747	But perhaps, though she has behaved so ill by our family, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the man she likes, she may be constant.	24	75	3	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
748	Indeed I am afraid she will; I am afraid she will be very constant, unless a baronet should come in her way; that is Frederick's only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the arrivals.	25	75	5	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
749	You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are some things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she first knew what my father would do for them, she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone's character in my life before.	26	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
750	Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.	27	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
751	My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poor James, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.	28	75	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
752	Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we must not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at Bath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent. You would not, for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could rely on. You feel all this?	29	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
753	No, I do not—ought I? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still love her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought.	30	75	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
754	You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature. Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves.	31	75	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
755	No, my father's hands need not be strengthened, and Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled. He must tell his own story.	1	76	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
756	But he will tell only half of it.	2	76	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
757	A quarter would be enough.	3	76	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
758	And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.	1	77	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
788	Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If you think it long—	5	82	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
789	Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as long again.	6	82	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
792	How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!	3	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
793	'Tis a messenger from Woodston!	4	83	3	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
759	Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There is no need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way. Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor's table. Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men. They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question. But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be with you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for us.	2	77	16	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
760	I am come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour. Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I must go away directly, two days before I intended it.	1	78	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
761	Go away! And why?	2	78	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
762	Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go and prepare a dinner for you, to be sure.	3	78	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
763	Oh! Not seriously!	4	78	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
764	Aye, and sadly too—for I had much rather stay.	5	78	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
765	But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble, because anything would do.	6	78	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
766	I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's account and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he had not said half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent dinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify.	7	78	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
767	I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own. Good-bye. As tomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.	8	78	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
768	We are not calling it a good house. e are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger—we are considering it as a mere parsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say otherwise; and anything in reason—a bow thrown out, perhaps—though, between ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion, it is a patched-on bow.	1	79	16	said	\N	f	f	f	f
769	Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a pity not to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is the prettiest room in the world!	1	80	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
770	I trust that it will very speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste!	2	80	16	said	\N	f	f	f	f
771	Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a sweet little cottage there is among the trees—apple trees, too! It is the prettiest cottage!	3	80	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
772	You like it—you approve it as an object—it is enough. Henry, remember that Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.	4	80	16	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
773	So much for Isabella, and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or she could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her. I see what she has been about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and I wish I had never known her.	1	81	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
774	It will soon be as if you never had.	2	81	5	said	\N	f	f	f	f
775	There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?	3	81	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
776	I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such as I believe them to have been. He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the chief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yet injured himself. If the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you, we had better not seek after the cause.	4	81	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
777	Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her?	5	81	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
778	I am persuaded that he never did.	6	81	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
779	And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?	7	81	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
780	Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all. Though it has turned out so well for us, I do not like him at all. As it happens, there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose. But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?	8	81	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
781	But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose—consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, she would have met with very different treatment.	9	81	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
782	It is very right that you should stand by your brother.	10	81	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
783	And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.	11	81	5	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
784	...hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time—had been misled (perhaps by her wishes) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised—and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there, they would be too generous to hasten her return.	1	82	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
785	Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all. As long as she was happy, they would always be satisfied.	2	82	3	explained	\N	f	f	f	f
786	Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?	3	82	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
787	Oh! Because she had been there so long.	4	82	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
794	You are mistaken, indeed; it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself.	5	83	12	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
795	You are too good, I am sure, to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a most unwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately been settled between us—how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted—and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by—But I must not trust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are to part. My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday. We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight. Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot attempt either.	6	83	12	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
796	My dear Eleanor, do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give way to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part—so soon, and so suddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my visit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Can you, when you return from this lord's, come to Fullerton?	7	83	3	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
797	It will not be in my power, Catherine.	8	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
798	Come when you can, then.	9	83	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
799	Monday—so soon as Monday; and you all go. Well, I am certain of—I shall be able to take leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know. Do not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My father and mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The general will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way—and then I shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.	10	83	3	added	\N	f	f	f	f
800	Ah, Catherine! Were it settled so, it would be somewhat less intolerable, though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought. But—how can I tell you?—tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice; the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o'clock, and no servant will be offered you.	11	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
801	I could hardly believe my senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment that you can feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than I myself—but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh! That I could suggest anything in extenuation! Good God! What will your father and mother say! After courting you from the protection of real friends to this—almost double distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house, without the considerations even of decent civility! Dear, dear Catherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty myself of all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it, that my real power is nothing.	12	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
802	Have I offended the general?	13	83	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
803	Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I answer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence. He certainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him more so. His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation, which just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?	14	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
804	I am sure, I am very sorry if I have offended him. It was the last thing I would willingly have done. But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement, you know, must be kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I might have written home. But it is of very little consequence.	15	83	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
805	I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort, appearance, propriety, to your family, to the world. Were your friends, the Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease; a few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to be taken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!	16	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
806	Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that. And if we are to part, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference. I can be ready by seven. Let me be called in time.	17	83	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
807	I shall see you in the morning.	18	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
790	My dear Catherine, you must not—you must not indeed—I am quite well. This kindness distracts me—I cannot bear it—I come to you on such an errand!	1	83	12	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
808	You must write to me, Catherine; you must let me hear from you as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall not have an hour's comfort. For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, I must entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct to me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.	1	84	12	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
809	No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am sure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home safe.	2	84	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
811	Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.	4	84	3	said	instantly	f	f	f	f
810	I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not importune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you.	3	84	12	replied	only	f	f	f	f
812	My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble; depend upon it, it is something not at all worth understanding.	1	85	2	said	at last	f	f	f	f
813	I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected this engagement, but why not do it civilly?	2	85	18	said	\N	f	f	f	f
814	I am sorry for the young people; they must have a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now; Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney.	3	85	2	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
815	Well, I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all over, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear Catherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much changing of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.	4	85	2	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
816	This has been a strange acquaintance; soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well, we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping.	1	86	2	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
817	No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor.	2	86	3	answered	warmly	f	f	f	f
818	If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do not be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!	3	86	2	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
819	We are sorry for him; but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without fortune; and now, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of her. Just at present it comes hard to poor James; but that will not last forever; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life, for the foolishness of his first choice.	1	87	2	said	\N	f	f	f	f
820	Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening. She travelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all of a sudden grew tired of having her there, and almost turned her out of the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he must be a very odd man; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again! And it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift very well for herself.	1	88	2	said	\N	f	f	f	f
821	I really have not patience with the general.	2	88	4	remark	single	f	f	f	f
822	I really have not patience with the general.	3	88	1	uttered	\N	f	f	f	f
823	Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one can hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bath is a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above half like coming away. Mrs. Thorpe's being there was such a comfort to us, was not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.	4	88	1	added	immediately	f	f	f	f
824	Yes, but that did not last long.	5	88	3	said	\N	f	f	f	f
825	Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for nothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you know, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember that evening?	6	88	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
826	Do I! Oh! Perfectly.	7	88	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
827	It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I always thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable. I have a notion you danced with him, but am not quite sure. I remember I had my favourite gown on.	8	88	1	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
828	I really have not patience with the general! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be! I do not suppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine. But no wonder; Milsom Street, you know.	9	88	1	returned	again	f	f	f	f
829	My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not know when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he had no friend but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for everything—a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.	1	89	2	reproof	gentle	f	f	f	f
830	...her head did not run upon Bath—much.	2	89	3	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
831	Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should never fret about trifles.	3	89	2	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
832	I hope, my Catherine, you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed. Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home, because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger.	4	89	2	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
833	I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what I eat.	5	89	3	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
834	There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance—The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some day or other, because I am sure it will do you good.	6	89	2	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
835	You may see the house from this window, sir.	1	90	18	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
836	Catherine would make a sad, heedless young housekeeper to be sure.	1	91	2	remark	foreboding	f	f	f	f
837	But it is; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.	2	8	8	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
838	Do you not want to know who has taken it?	3	8	8	cried	impatiently	f	f	f	f
839	You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.	4	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
840	Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.	5	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
841	What is his name?	6	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
842	Bingley.	7	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
843	Is he married or single?	8	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
844	Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!	9	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
845	How so? How can it affect them?	10	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
846	My dear Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.	11	8	8	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
847	Is that his design in settling here?	12	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
848	Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.	13	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
849	I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.	14	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
850	My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.	15	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
851	In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.	16	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3373	Well, Miss Woodhouse!—is not this the oddest news that ever was?	1	354	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3385	Harriet! Let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you speaking of—Mr. Knightley?	13	354	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3394	Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?	22	354	48	said	hastily	f	f	f	f
852	But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.	17	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
853	It is more than I engage for, I assure you.	18	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
854	But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.	19	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
855	You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.	20	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
856	I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.	21	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
857	They have none of them much to recommend them; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.	22	8	19	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
858	Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.	23	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
859	You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.	24	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
860	Ah, you do not know what I suffer.	25	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
861	But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.	26	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
862	It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.	27	8	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
863	Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.	28	8	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
864	I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.	1	92	19	addressed	suddenly	f	f	f	f
865	We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes, since we are not to visit.	2	92	8	said	resentfully	f	f	f	f
866	But you forget, mamma, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.	3	92	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
867	I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.	4	92	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
868	No more have I; and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.	5	92	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
869	Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.	6	92	8	scolding	\N	f	f	f	f
870	Kitty has no discretion in her coughs; she times them ill.	7	92	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
871	I do not cough for my own amusement. When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?	8	92	21	replied	fretfully	f	f	f	f
872	To-morrow fortnight.	9	92	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
873	Aye, so it is, and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.	10	92	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
874	Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.	11	92	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
875	Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?	12	92	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
876	I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.	13	92	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
877	Nonsense, nonsense!	14	92	8	said	only	f	f	f	f
878	What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.	15	92	19	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
879	While Mary is adjusting her ideas, let us return to Mr. Bingley.	16	92	19	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
880	I am sick of Mr. Bingley.	17	92	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
881	I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.	18	92	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
882	How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.	19	92	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
883	Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose.	20	92	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
884	What an excellent father you have, girls! I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.	21	92	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
885	Oh! I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I’m the tallest.	22	92	22	said	stoutly	f	f	f	f
886	If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield, and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.	1	93	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
887	Come, Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.	1	94	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
888	I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.	2	94	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
889	I would not be so fastidious as you are, for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.	3	94	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
890	You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.	4	94	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
994	In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure; and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.	4	104	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
891	Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.	5	94	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
892	Which do you mean?	6	94	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
893	She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.	7	94	24	said	coldly	f	f	f	f
894	Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet, we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—	1	95	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
895	If he had had any compassion for me, he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!	2	95	19	cried	impatiently	f	f	f	f
896	Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—	3	95	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
897	But I can assure you, that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.	4	95	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
898	He is just what a young man ought to be, sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!	1	96	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
899	He is also handsome, which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.	2	96	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
900	I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.	3	96	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
901	Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.	4	96	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
902	Dear Lizzy!	5	96	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
903	Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.	6	96	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
904	I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.	7	96	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
905	I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.	8	96	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
906	Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.	9	96	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
907	You began the evening well, Charlotte. You were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.	1	97	8	said	with civil self-command	f	f	f	f
908	Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.	2	97	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
909	Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson.	3	97	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
910	Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.’	4	97	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
911	Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.	5	97	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
912	My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza. Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.	6	97	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
913	I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.	7	97	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
914	Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake? I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.	8	97	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
915	Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.	9	97	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
916	Miss Bingley told me that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable.	10	97	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
917	I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.	11	97	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
918	I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long, but I wish he had danced with Eliza.	12	97	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
919	Another time, Lizzy, I would not dance with him, if I were you.	13	97	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
920	I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.	14	97	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
921	His pride does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.	15	97	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
922	That is very true, and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.	16	97	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
923	Pride is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.	17	97	27	observed	\N	t	f	f	f
924	If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy, I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.	18	97	28	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
925	Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought; and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.	19	97	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
926	It may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.	1	98	26	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
927	But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.	2	98	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
928	Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.	3	98	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
929	But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.	4	98	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
930	Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.	5	98	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
931	Your plan is a good one where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.	6	98	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
932	Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.	7	98	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
933	Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.	8	98	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
934	Well, I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.	9	98	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
935	You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.	10	98	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
936	What does Mr. Darcy mean by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?	1	99	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
937	That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.	2	99	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
938	But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.	3	99	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
939	Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?	1	100	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
940	With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.	2	100	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
941	You are severe on us.	3	100	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
942	It will be her turn soon to be teased. I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.	4	100	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
943	You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.	5	100	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
944	Very well, if it must be so, it must.	6	100	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
945	There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.	7	100	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
946	From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.	1	101	19	observed	coolly	f	f	f	f
947	I am astonished, my dear, that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.	2	101	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
948	If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.	3	101	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
949	Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.	4	101	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3118	With you, if you will ask me.	12	330	48	replied	then	f	f	f	f
950	This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.	5	101	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
951	My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his regimentals.	6	101	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
952	Mamma, my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.	7	101	22	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
953	Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.	8	101	8	calling out	eagerly	f	f	f	f
954	It is from Miss Bingley.	9	101	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
955	With the officers! I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.	10	101	22	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
956	Dining out, that is very unlucky.	11	101	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
957	Can I have the carriage?	12	101	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
958	No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.	13	101	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
959	That would be a good scheme, if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.	14	101	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
960	Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.	15	101	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
961	I had much rather go in the coach.	16	101	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
962	But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?	17	101	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
963	They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.	18	101	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
964	But if you have got them to-day, my mother’s purpose will be answered.	19	101	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
965	This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!	1	102	8	said	more than once	f	f	f	f
966	Well, my dear, if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.	2	102	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
967	Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.	3	102	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
968	How can you be so silly, as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.	4	102	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
969	I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.	5	102	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
970	Is this a hint to me, Lizzy, to send for the horses?	6	102	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
971	No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.	7	102	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
972	I admire the activity of your benevolence, but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.	8	102	27	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
973	We will go as far as Meryton with you.	9	102	29	said	\N	f	f	f	f
974	If we make haste, perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.	10	102	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
975	She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.	1	103	30	added	\N	f	f	f	f
976	She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!	2	103	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
977	Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.	3	103	30	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
978	Your picture may be very exact, Louisa; but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.	4	103	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
979	You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure; and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.	5	103	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
980	Certainly not.	6	103	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
981	To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.	7	103	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
982	It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing.	8	103	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
983	I am afraid, Mr. Darcy, that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.	9	103	31	observed	in a half whisper	f	f	f	f
984	Not at all; they were brightened by the exercise.	10	103	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
985	I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.	11	103	30	began	again	f	f	f	f
986	I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.	12	103	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
987	Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.	13	103	30	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
988	That is capital.	14	103	31	added	\N	f	f	f	f
989	If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside, it would not make them one jot less agreeable.	15	103	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
990	But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world.	16	103	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
991	Do you prefer reading to cards?; that is rather singular.	1	104	32	said	\N	f	f	f	f
992	Miss Eliza Bennet despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.	2	104	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
993	I deserve neither such praise nor such censure; I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.	3	104	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1075	And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?	22	107	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
995	And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.	5	104	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
996	I am astonished that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!	6	104	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
997	It ought to be good, it has been the work of many generations.	7	104	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
998	And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.	8	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
999	I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.	9	104	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1000	Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.	10	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3374	What news do you mean?	2	354	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1001	I wish it may.	11	104	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1002	But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.	12	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1003	With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.	13	104	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1004	I am talking of possibilities, Charles.	14	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1005	Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.	15	104	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1006	Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?; will she be as tall as I am?	16	104	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1007	I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or rather taller.	17	104	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1008	How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.	18	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1009	It is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.	19	104	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1010	All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?	20	104	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1011	Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.	21	104	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1012	Your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.	22	104	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1013	Nor I, I am sure.	23	104	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1014	Then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.	24	104	20	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
3395	Yes—I must say that I have.	23	354	50	replied	modestly, but not fearfully	f	f	f	f
1015	Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.	25	104	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1016	Oh! certainly, no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.	26	104	31	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1017	All this she must possess, and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.	27	104	24	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1018	I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.	28	104	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1019	Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?	29	104	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1020	I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.	30	104	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1021	Elizabeth Bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.	1	105	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1022	Undoubtedly, there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.	2	105	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1023	Indeed I have, sir. She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.	1	106	8	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
1024	Removed! It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.	2	106	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1025	You may depend upon it, Madam, that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.	3	106	31	said	with cold civility	f	f	f	f
1026	I am sure if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.	4	106	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1027	Whatever I do is done in a hurry; and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.	5	106	23	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1028	That is exactly what I should have supposed of you.	6	106	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1029	You begin to comprehend me, do you?	7	106	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1030	Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.	8	106	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1031	I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.	9	106	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1032	That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.	10	106	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1033	Lizzy, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.	11	106	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1034	I did not know before that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.	12	106	23	continued	immediately	f	f	f	f
1035	Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.	13	106	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1036	The country can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.	14	106	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1037	But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.	15	106	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1038	Yes, indeed. I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.	16	106	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1039	I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?	17	106	8	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1040	When I am in the country, I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.	18	106	23	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1041	Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all.	19	106	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1042	Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken. You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.	20	106	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1043	Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.	21	106	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1044	Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.	22	106	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1045	Did Charlotte dine with you?	23	106	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1046	No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.	24	106	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1047	She seems a very pleasant young woman.	25	106	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1048	Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.	26	106	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1049	And so ended his affection. There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!	27	106	20	said	impatiently	f	f	f	f
1050	I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love.	28	106	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1051	Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.	29	106	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1052	I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.	30	106	23	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
1053	Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball, I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.	31	106	22	declared	\N	f	f	f	f
1054	How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!	1	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1055	You write uncommonly fast.	2	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1056	You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.	3	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1057	How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!	4	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1058	It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.	5	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1059	Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.	6	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1060	I have already told her so once, by your desire.	7	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1061	I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.	8	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1062	Thank you—but I always mend my own.	9	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1063	How can you contrive to write so even?	10	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1064	Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.	11	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1065	Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.	12	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1066	Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?	13	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1067	They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.	14	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1068	It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.	15	107	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1069	That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline, because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?	16	107	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1070	My style of writing is very different from yours.	17	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1071	Oh!, Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.	18	107	31	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1072	My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.	19	107	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1073	Your humility, Mr. Bingley, must disarm reproof.	20	107	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1074	Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.	21	107	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3119	Will you?	13	330	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1076	The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?	23	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1077	Nay, this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.	24	107	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1078	I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month.	25	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1079	You have only proved by this that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.	26	107	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1080	I am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.	27	107	23	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1081	Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?	28	107	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1082	Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.	29	107	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3375	About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!—you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.	3	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1083	You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.	30	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1084	To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.	31	107	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1085	To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.	32	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1086	You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?	33	107	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1087	Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?	34	107	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1088	By all means; let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.	35	107	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1089	I see your design, Bingley. You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.	36	107	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1090	Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.	37	107	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1091	What you ask is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.	38	107	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1092	Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?	1	108	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1093	Oh!, I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.	2	108	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1094	Indeed I do not dare.	3	108	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1095	I hope you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.	1	109	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1096	Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?	2	109	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1097	Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?	3	109	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1098	It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.	4	109	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1099	I did not know that you intended to walk.	5	109	31	said	in some confusion	f	f	f	f
1100	You used us abominably ill, running away without telling us that you were coming out.	6	109	30	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3430	You speak as if you envied him.	19	356	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1101	This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.	7	109	24	said	immediately	f	f	f	f
1102	No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.	8	109	20	answered	laughingly	f	f	f	f
1103	How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.	1	110	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1104	By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.	2	110	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1105	If you mean Darcy, he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.	3	110	23	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1106	I should like balls infinitely better if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.	4	110	31	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1107	Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.	5	110	23	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1108	Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.	6	110	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1109	Not at all; but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.	7	110	20	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
1110	I have not the smallest objection to explaining them. You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.	8	110	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1111	Oh! shocking! I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?	9	110	31	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1112	Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination. We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.	10	110	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1113	But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.	11	110	31	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1114	Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at! That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.	12	110	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1115	Miss Bingley has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.	13	110	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1116	Certainly—there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.	14	110	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1117	Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.	15	110	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1118	Such as vanity and pride.	16	110	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1119	Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.	17	110	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1120	Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume; and pray what is the result?	18	110	31	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1121	I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.	19	110	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1122	No, I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.	20	110	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1123	That is a failing indeed! Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.	21	110	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1124	There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.	22	110	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1125	And your defect is to hate everybody.	23	110	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1126	And yours is willfully to misunderstand them.	24	110	24	replied	with a smile	f	f	f	f
1127	Do let us have a little music. Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?	25	110	31	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1128	I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.	1	111	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1129	Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.	2	111	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1130	The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.	3	111	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1131	A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this moment.	4	111	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1132	It is not Mr. Bingley; it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.	5	111	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1133	About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.	6	111	19	explained	\N	f	f	f	f
1480	It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.	11	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1134	Oh! my dear, I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.	7	111	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1135	It certainly is a most iniquitous affair, and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.	8	111	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1136	No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?	9	111	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1137	Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.	10	111	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1138	Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.  “Dear Sir,— “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,  “WILLIAM COLLINS”	11	111	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1139	At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman. He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.	18	111	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1140	There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.	13	111	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1141	Though it is difficult, to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.	14	111	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1142	He must be an oddity, I think. I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?	15	111	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1143	No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.	16	111	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1144	In point of composition, the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.	17	111	27	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1145	You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.	1	112	8	answered	most readily	f	f	f	f
1146	You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.	2	112	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1147	Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.	3	112	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1148	I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—	4	112	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1149	he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs.	1	113	33	protested	\N	f	f	f	f
1150	That is all very proper and civil, I am sure, and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?	2	113	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1151	The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.	3	113	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1152	I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?	4	113	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1153	She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.	5	113	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1154	Ah!, then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?	6	113	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1155	She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.	7	113	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1156	Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.	8	113	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1157	Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.	9	113	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1158	You judge very properly,  and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?	10	113	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1159	They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.	11	113	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1481	An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.	12	160	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1160	Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.	1	114	22	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
1161	I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.	2	114	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1162	As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.	1	115	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1163	I know little of the game at present, but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—	1	116	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1164	About a month. He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.	1	117	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1165	Yes; his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.	2	117	34	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1166	You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?	3	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1167	As much as I ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.	4	117	20	cried	very warmly	f	f	f	f
1168	I have no right to give my opinion as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.	5	117	34	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1169	Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.	6	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1170	I cannot pretend to be sorry that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.	7	117	34	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1171	I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.	8	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1172	I wonder whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.	9	117	34	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1173	I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.	10	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1174	Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.	11	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1175	It was the prospect of constant society, and good society, which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.	12	117	34	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1176	Indeed!	13	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1177	Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.	14	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1178	Good heavens!; but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?	15	117	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1179	There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.	16	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1180	This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.	17	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1181	Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.	18	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1182	But what can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?	19	117	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1183	A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.	20	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1184	I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.	21	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1185	I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.	22	117	20	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1186	I will not trust myself on the subject; I can hardly be just to him.	23	117	34	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1187	To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!	24	117	20	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
1188	and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!	25	117	20	contented	\N	f	f	f	f
1189	We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.	26	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1190	How strange! How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.	27	117	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1191	It is wonderful, for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.	28	117	34	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1192	Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?	29	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1193	Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.	30	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1194	What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?	31	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1195	I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.	32	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1196	I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?	33	117	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1197	Not at all.	34	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1198	He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.	35	117	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1199	Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.	36	117	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1200	I know very well, madam, that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.	1	118	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1201	Lady Catherine de Bourgh has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.	2	118	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1202	You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.	3	118	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1203	No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.	4	118	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1204	Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.	5	118	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1205	Mr. Collins speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.	6	118	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1206	I believe her to be both in a great degree; I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.	7	118	34	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1208	Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.	2	119	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1207	They have both been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.	1	119	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1313	Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:	4	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1448	What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.	1	158	39	call out	\N	f	f	f	f
1476	This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.	7	160	24	began	\N	f	f	f	f
1209	Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.	3	119	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1210	I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.	4	119	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1211	It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think.	5	119	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1212	I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.	6	119	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1213	While I can have my mornings to myself, it is enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.	1	120	27	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1214	I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you, that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.	2	120	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1215	I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.	1	121	35	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1216	I dare say you will find him very agreeable.	1	122	26	tried to console	\N	f	f	f	f
1217	Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.	2	122	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1218	It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.	1	123	20	addressed	\N	f	f	f	f
1219	Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent.	2	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1220	Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?	3	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1221	Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.	4	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1222	Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?	5	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1223	Both; for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the éclat of a proverb.	6	123	20	replied	archly	f	f	f	f
1224	This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure. How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.	7	123	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1225	I must not decide on my own performance.	8	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1226	When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.	9	123	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1227	Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.	10	123	24	said	in a constrained manner	f	f	f	f
1228	He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.	11	123	20	replied	with emphasis	f	f	f	f
1229	I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.	12	123	36	addressed	\N	f	f	f	f
1230	Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.	13	123	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1231	I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.	14	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1232	What think you of books?	15	123	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1233	Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.	16	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1234	I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.	17	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1235	No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.	18	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1236	The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?	19	123	24	said	with a look of doubt	f	f	f	f
1237	Yes, always.	20	123	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1238	I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?	21	123	20	exclaiming	suddenly	f	f	f	f
1239	I am.	22	123	24	said	with a firm voice	f	f	f	f
1240	And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?	23	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1241	I hope not.	24	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1242	It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.	25	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1243	May I ask to what these questions tend?	26	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1244	Merely to the illustration of your character. I am trying to make it out.	27	123	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1245	And what is your success?	28	123	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1246	I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.	29	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1449	We are speaking of music, madam.	2	158	40	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1247	I can readily believe that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.	30	123	24	answered	gravely	f	f	f	f
1248	But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.	31	123	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1249	I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.	32	123	24	replied	coldly	f	f	f	f
1250	So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.	1	124	31	accosted	with an expression of civil disdain	f	f	f	f
1251	His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same; for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.	2	124	20	said	angrily	f	f	f	f
1252	I beg your pardon. Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.	3	124	31	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1253	I want to know what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.	1	125	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1254	No, I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.	2	125	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1255	Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?	3	125	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1256	No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.	4	125	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1257	This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?	5	125	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1258	He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.	6	125	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1259	I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.	7	125	20	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
1260	I have found out by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.	1	126	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1261	You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!	2	126	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1262	Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.	3	126	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1263	My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.	4	126	33	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1264	I have no reason, I assure you, to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.	1	127	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1265	What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.	1	128	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1266	For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!	2	128	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1267	That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.	1	129	19	said	aloud	f	f	f	f
1286	But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins, that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it.	1	133	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1338	Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?	2	139	26	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
3121	Brother and sister! no, indeed.	15	330	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1268	If I were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.	1	130	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1269	May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?	1	131	33	addressed	\N	f	f	f	f
1270	Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.	2	131	8	answered	instantly	f	f	f	f
1271	Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.	3	131	20	called	\N	f	f	f	f
1272	No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.	4	131	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1273	Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.	5	131	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1274	Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.	1	132	33	began	\N	f	f	f	f
1275	My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.	2	132	33	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1276	You are too hasty, sir. You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.	3	132	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1277	I am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.	4	132	33	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1278	Upon my word, sir, your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.	5	132	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1279	Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so—but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.	6	132	33	said	very gravely	f	f	f	f
1280	Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.	7	132	20	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
1281	When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.	8	132	33	addressed	\N	f	f	f	f
1282	Really, Mr. Collins, you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.	9	132	20	cried	with some warmth	f	f	f	f
1283	You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.	10	132	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1284	I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.	11	132	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1285	You are uniformly charming!; and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.	12	132	33	cried	with an air of awkward gallantry	f	f	f	f
1287	Pardon me for interrupting you, madam; but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.	2	133	33	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1288	Sir, you quite misunderstand me. Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.	3	133	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1289	Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.	4	133	8	called out	\N	f	f	f	f
1290	I have not the pleasure of understanding you. Of what are you talking?	5	133	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1291	Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.	6	133	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1292	And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.	7	133	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1293	Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.	8	133	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1294	Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.	9	133	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1295	Come here, child. I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?	10	133	19	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1296	I have, sir.	11	133	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1297	Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?	12	133	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1298	Yes, or I will never see her again.	13	133	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1299	An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.	14	133	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1300	What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.	15	133	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1301	My dear, I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.	16	133	19	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1302	I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.	1	134	22	cried	in a half whisper	f	f	f	f
1303	Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas, for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.	2	134	8	added	in a melancholy tone	f	f	f	f
1304	Aye, there she comes, looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.	3	134	8	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1305	Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.	4	134	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1306	Oh! Mr. Collins!	5	134	8	began	\N	f	f	f	f
1307	My dear madam, let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.	6	134	33	replied/continued	in a voice that marked his displeasure	f	f	f	f
1308	I found as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.	1	135	34	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1309	This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.	1	136	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3376	What did Mr. Weston tell you?	4	354	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1311	I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.	2	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1312	It is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.	3	136	20	said	after a short pause	f	f	f	f
3386	To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as possible.	14	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5562	Yes, sir.	18	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1314	When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.	5	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1315	It is evident by this that he comes back no more this winter.	6	136	25	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1316	It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.	7	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1317	Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.	8	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1318	Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?	9	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1319	What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy? Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?	10	136	25	said	as she finished it	f	f	f	f
1320	Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?	11	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1321	Most willingly.	12	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1322	You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.	13	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1323	Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.	14	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1324	If we thought alike of Miss Bingley, your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.	15	136	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1325	That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.	16	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1326	But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?	17	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1327	You must decide for yourself; and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.	18	136	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1328	How can you talk so? You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.	19	136	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1329	I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.	20	136	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1330	But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!	21	136	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1331	It keeps him in good humour, and I am more obliged to you than I can express.	1	137	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1332	My dear madam, this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.	1	138	33	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1333	But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.	2	138	19	said	immediately	f	f	f	f
1334	My dear sir, I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.	3	138	33	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1335	You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.	4	138	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1336	Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.	5	138	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1337	Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!	1	139	20	crying	out	f	f	f	f
1443	With three younger sisters grown up, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.	21	155	20	replied	smiling	f	f	f	f
1339	I see what you are feeling. You must be surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.	3	139	26	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1340	Undoubtedly.	4	139	20	answered	quietly	f	f	f	f
1341	Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?	1	140	22	exclaimed	boisterously	f	f	f	f
1342	Indeed, Mr. Bennet, it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!	1	141	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1343	My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.	2	141	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1344	I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.	3	141	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1345	What should not you mind?	4	141	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1346	I should not mind anything at all.	5	141	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1347	Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.	6	141	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1348	I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?	7	141	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1349	I leave it to yourself to determine.	8	141	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1350	Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.	1	142	25	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1351	You doubt me; indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.	2	142	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1352	I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.	3	142	25	added	soon	f	f	f	f
1353	My dear Jane!, you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.	4	142	20	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
1354	Nay, this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!	5	142	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1355	My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.	6	142	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1356	To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.	7	142	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1357	I must think your language too strong in speaking of both; and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.	8	142	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1358	And men take care that they should.	9	142	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1359	If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.	10	142	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1360	I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design; but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.	11	142	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1361	And do you impute it to either of those?	12	142	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1362	Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.	13	142	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1363	You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?	14	142	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1364	Yes, in conjunction with his friend.	15	142	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1365	I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.	16	142	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1366	Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.	17	142	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1444	You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.	22	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1478	Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.	9	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1367	Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.	18	142	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1368	So, Lizzy, your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.	1	143	19	said	one day	f	f	f	f
1369	Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.	2	143	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1370	True, but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.	3	143	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1371	I do not blame Jane, for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.	1	144	8	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1372	It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane. I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.	1	145	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1373	An excellent consolation in its way, but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.	2	145	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1374	But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley’s love?	3	145	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1375	I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?	4	145	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1376	Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.	5	145	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1377	I hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.	6	145	37	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1378	And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.	7	145	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1379	So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.	8	145	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1380	She will drop the acquaintance entirely.	9	145	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1381	You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.	1	146	37	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
1382	My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.	2	146	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1383	Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.	3	146	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1384	Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.	4	146	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1385	Elizabeth, you are not serious now.	5	146	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1446	I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.	1	156	26	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
1482	And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.	13	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1483	I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match. I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.	14	160	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2068	I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.	18	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1386	I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.	6	146	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1387	Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him.	7	146	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1388	As I did the other day: very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.	8	146	20	said	with a conscious smile	f	f	f	f
1389	I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.	1	147	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1390	That you certainly shall.	2	147	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1391	And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?	3	147	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1392	We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.	4	147	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1393	I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.	5	147	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1394	My father and Maria are coming to me in March, and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.	6	147	26	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1395	I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.	1	149	20	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
1396	But my dear Elizabeth, what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.	1	150	37	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1397	Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.	2	150	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1398	If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.	3	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1399	She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.	4	150	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1400	But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune.	5	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1401	No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?	6	150	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1402	But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.	7	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1403	A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?	8	150	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1404	Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.	9	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1405	Well, have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.	10	150	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1406	No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.	11	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1407	Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.	12	150	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1408	Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.	13	150	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1409	We have not determined how far it shall carry us, but, perhaps, to the Lakes.	14	150	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1410	Oh, my dear, dear aunt, what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.	15	150	20	cried	rapturously	f	f	f	f
1447	My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?	1	157	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1479	Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.	10	160	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1484	It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.	15	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1411	Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.	1	151	33	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
1412	Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed, and a most attentive neighbour.	2	151	26	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1413	Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.	3	151	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1414	Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.	1	152	38	cried out	\N	f	f	f	f
1415	And is this all? I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.	2	152	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1416	La! my dear, it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?	3	152	38	said	quite shocked at the mistake	f	f	f	f
1417	She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?	4	152	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1418	Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.	5	152	38	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1419	I like her appearance. She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.	6	152	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1420	I confess that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!	1	153	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1421	I am the less surprised at what has happened from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.	2	153	36	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1422	Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.	1	154	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1423	Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake, I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?	1	155	39	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
1424	A little.	2	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1425	Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?	3	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1426	One of them does.	4	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1427	Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?	5	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1428	No, not at all.	6	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1429	What, none of you?	7	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1430	Not one.	8	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1431	That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.	9	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1432	My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.	10	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1433	Has your governess left you?	11	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1434	We never had any governess.	12	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1435	No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.	13	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1436	Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.	14	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1437	Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.	15	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1438	Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?	16	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1439	Yes, ma’am, all.	17	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1440	All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?	18	155	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1441	Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.	19	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1442	Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?	20	155	39	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1445	I am not one-and-twenty.	23	155	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1450	Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?	3	158	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1451	I am very glad to hear such a good account of her; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.	4	158	39	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1452	I assure you, madam, that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.	5	158	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1453	So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house.	6	158	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1454	You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.	1	159	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1455	I shall not say you are mistaken, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.	2	159	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3377	Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while. How very odd!	5	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1457	Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.	3	159	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1458	I am not afraid of you.	4	159	24	said	smilingly	f	f	f	f
1459	Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of. I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.	5	159	40	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1460	You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.	6	159	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1461	I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.	7	159	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1462	True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.	8	159	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1463	Perhaps I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.	9	159	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1464	Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?	10	159	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1465	I can answer your question without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.	11	159	40	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1466	I certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.	12	159	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1467	My fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.	13	159	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1468	You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.	14	159	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1469	Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.	15	159	39	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1470	How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?	1	160	20	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
1471	Perfectly so, I thank you.	2	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1472	I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?	3	160	20	added	after a short pause	f	f	f	f
1473	I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.	4	160	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1474	If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.	5	160	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1475	I should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.	6	160	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1477	I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.	8	160	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3387	Not quite, for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.	15	354	48	replied	with forced calmness	f	f	f	f
1485	I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.	16	160	20	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
1486	You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn.	17	160	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1487	Are you pleased with Kent?	18	160	24	said	in a colder voice	f	f	f	f
1488	What can be the meaning of this? My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.	1	161	26	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1489	I did not know before that you ever walked this way.	1	162	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1490	I have been making the tour of the park, as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?	2	162	40	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1491	No, I should have turned in a moment.	3	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1492	Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?	4	162	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1493	Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.	5	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1494	And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.	6	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1495	He likes to have his own way very well. But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.	7	162	40	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1496	In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?	8	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1497	These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.	9	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1498	Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.	10	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1499	Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.	11	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1500	And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.	12	162	20	said	in a lively tone	f	f	f	f
1501	I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.	13	162	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1502	No, that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.	14	162	40	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1503	Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.	15	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1504	You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.	17	162	20	replied	directly	f	f	f	f
1505	I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.	18	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1506	Oh! yes; Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.	19	162	20	said	drily	f	f	f	f
1507	Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.	20	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1508	What is it you mean?	21	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1509	It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.	22	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1510	You may depend upon my not mentioning it.	23	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1511	And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.	24	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1512	Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?	25	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1513	I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.	26	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1514	And what arts did he use to separate them?	27	162	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1515	He did not talk to me of his own arts. He only told me what I have now told you.	28	162	40	said	smilingly	f	f	f	f
1516	I am thinking of what you have been telling me. Your cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?	30	162	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1517	You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?	31	162	40	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1518	I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But, as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.	32	162	20	continued	recollecting herself	f	f	f	f
1519	That is not an unnatural surmise, but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.	33	162	40	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1520	In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.	1	163	24	began	thus	f	f	f	f
2117	Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!	11	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1521	In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.	2	163	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1522	And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.	3	163	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1523	I might as well inquire why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?	4	163	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1524	I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.	5	163	20	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1525	Can you deny that you have done it?	6	163	20	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
1526	I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.	7	163	24	replied	then	f	f	f	f
1527	But it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?	8	163	20	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1528	You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns.	9	163	24	said	in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour	f	f	f	f
1529	Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?	10	163	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1530	His misfortunes!; yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.	11	163	24	repeated	contemptuously	f	f	f	f
1531	And of your infliction. You have reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.	12	163	20	cried	with energy	f	f	f	f
1532	And this is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?	13	163	24	cried/added	\N	f	f	f	f
1533	You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.	14	163	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1534	You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.	15	163	20	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1535	From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.	16	163	20	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
1536	You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.	17	163	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1537	I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?	1	164	24	said	with a look of haughty composure	f	f	f	f
1538	I assure you, I feel it exceedingly; I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.	1	165	39	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1539	But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.	1	166	39	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1540	I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday.	2	166	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1541	Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.	3	166	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1542	But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.	4	166	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1590	You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.	20	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2762	Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!	1	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1543	Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.	5	166	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1544	You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.	6	166	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1545	Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.	7	166	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1546	My uncle is to send a servant for us.	8	166	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1547	Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.	9	166	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1548	I know not, Miss Elizabeth, whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.	1	167	33	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1549	It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.	2	167	33	replied	with a more smiling solemnity	f	f	f	f
1550	You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.	3	167	33	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1551	But, you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.	1	168	33	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1552	Good gracious!, it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!	2	168	38	cried	after a few minutes' silence	f	f	f	f
1553	A great many indeed.	3	168	20	said	with a sigh	f	f	f	f
1554	We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!	4	168	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1555	Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?	1	169	29	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
1556	And we mean to treat you all, but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.	2	169	22	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1557	Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.	3	169	22	\N	showing her purchases	f	f	f	f
1558	Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.	4	169	22	added	with perfect unconcern	f	f	f	f
1559	Are they indeed!	5	169	20	cried	with the greatest satisfaction	f	f	f	f
1560	They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!	6	169	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1561	Now I have got some news for you. What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!	7	169	22	said	as they sat down at table	f	f	f	f
1562	Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.	8	169	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1563	And Mary King is safe!; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.	9	169	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1564	She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.	10	169	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1565	But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side.	11	169	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1566	I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?	12	169	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1736	Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.	19	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5563	Refuse him?	19	569	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1567	How nicely we are all crammed in. I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.	1	170	22	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1568	I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.	1	171	19	say	voluntarily	f	f	f	f
1569	Oh! Mary, I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!	1	172	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1570	Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book.	2	172	27	replied	very gravely	f	f	f	f
1571	His being so sure of succeeding was wrong, and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!	1	174	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1572	Indeed, I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?	2	174	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1573	Blame you! Oh, no.	3	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1574	But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?	4	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1575	No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.	5	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1576	But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.	6	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1577	This will not do; you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you choose.	7	174	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1578	I do not know when I have been more shocked. Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.	8	174	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1579	Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.	9	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1580	Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!	10	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1581	There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.	11	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1582	I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.	12	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1583	And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.	13	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1584	Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.	14	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1585	Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!	15	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1586	How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.	16	174	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1587	Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.	17	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1588	Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?	18	174	25	replied	then	f	f	f	f
1589	That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.	19	174	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5564	Yes, sir.	20	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1591	Well, Lizzy, what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.	1	175	8	said	one day	f	f	f	f
1592	I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.	2	175	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1593	Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.	3	175	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1594	Well, Lizzy, and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.	4	175	8	continued	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
1595	No, nothing at all.	5	175	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1596	A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.	6	175	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1597	It was a subject which they could not mention before me.	7	175	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1598	No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.	8	175	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1599	Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do? How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?	1	176	29	exclaim	often	f	f	f	f
1600	I am sure, I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.	2	176	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1601	I am sure I shall break mine.	3	176	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1602	If one could but go to Brighton!	4	176	8	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
1603	Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.	5	176	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1604	A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.	6	176	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1605	And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good.	7	176	21	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1606	I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia, Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.	1	177	21	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1607	Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.	1	178	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1608	If you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.	2	178	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1609	Already arisen? What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.	3	178	19	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
1610	Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?	4	178	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1611	Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.	5	178	19	said	in reply	f	f	f	f
1612	How long did you say he was at Rosings?	1	179	34	added	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
1613	Nearly three weeks.	2	179	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1614	And you saw him frequently?	3	179	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1615	Yes, almost every day.	4	179	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1616	His manners are very different from his cousin’s.	5	179	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1617	Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.	6	179	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1618	Indeed! And pray, may I ask?—	7	179	34	cried	with a look which did not escape her	f	f	f	f
1619	Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.	8	179	34	added	in a gayer tone	f	f	f	f
1620	Oh, no! In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.	9	179	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1621	When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.	10	179	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1622	You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.	11	179	34	said	in the gentlest of accents	f	f	f	f
1623	My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?; a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.	1	180	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1624	If it were merely a fine house richly furnished, I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.	2	180	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1625	But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.	1	181	41	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
1626	He is now gone into the army; but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.	2	181	41	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1627	And that is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.	3	181	41	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1628	I have heard much of your master’s fine person; it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.	4	181	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1629	Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?	5	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1630	A little.	6	181	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1631	And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?	7	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1632	Yes, very handsome.	8	181	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1633	I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.	9	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1634	And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?	10	181	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1635	Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.	11	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1636	Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?	12	181	42	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1637	Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.	13	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1638	If your master would marry, you might see more of him.	14	181	42	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1639	Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.	15	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1640	It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.	16	181	20	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1641	I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him	17	181	41	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1642	I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.	18	181	41	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1643	There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.	19	181	42	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1644	Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.	20	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1645	His father was an excellent man.	21	181	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1646	Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor.	22	181	41	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1647	He is the best landlord, and the best master that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.	23	181	41	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1648	This fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.	24	181	37	whispered	as they walked	f	f	f	f
1649	Perhaps we might be deceived.	25	181	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1650	That is not very likely; our authority was too good.	26	181	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1651	He is certainly a good brother.	27	181	20	said	as she walked towards one of the windows	f	f	f	f
1652	And this is always the way with him. Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.	28	181	41	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1653	for your housekeeper, informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.	1	182	20	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1654	They will join me early to-morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.	2	182	24	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1655	There is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?	3	182	24	continued	after a pause	f	f	f	f
1656	He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming.	1	183	42	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1657	There is something a little stately in him, to be sure, but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.	2	183	37	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1658	I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.	3	183	42	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1659	To be sure, Lizzy, he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?	4	183	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1660	But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities. Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.	5	183	42	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2115	He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.	9	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1661	From what we have seen of him, I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.	6	183	37	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1662	was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her	1	184	23	observed	in a tone which had something of real regret	f	f	f	f
1663	It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.	2	184	23	added	before she could reply	f	f	f	f
1664	Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.	1	185	31	saying	with sneering civility	f	f	f	f
1665	How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy; I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.	1	186	31	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1666	For my own part, I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.	2	186	31	rejoined	\N	f	f	f	f
1667	I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.	3	186	31	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1668	Yes, but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.	4	186	24	replied	who could contain himself no longer	f	f	f	f
1669	Oh! where, where is my uncle?	1	187	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1670	I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.	2	187	20	exclaimed	hastily	f	f	f	f
1671	Good God! what is the matter?	3	187	24	cried	with more feeling than politeness	f	f	f	f
1672	I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.	4	187	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1673	Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.	5	187	24	saying	in a tone of gentleness and commiseration	f	f	f	f
1674	No, I thank you. There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.	6	187	20	replied	endeavouring to recover herself	f	f	f	f
1675	I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.	7	187	20	spoke	again	f	f	f	f
1676	When I consider that I might have prevented it! I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now.	8	187	20	added	in a yet more agitated voice	f	f	f	f
1677	I am grieved indeed; grieved—shocked. But is it certain—absolutely certain?	9	187	24	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1678	Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.	10	187	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1679	And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?	11	187	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1680	My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!	12	187	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1681	When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!	13	187	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1682	I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.	14	187	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1683	Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.	15	187	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1684	But what is to be done about Pemberley? John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?	1	188	37	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1685	Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.	2	188	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1686	What is all settled? And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!	3	188	37	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
1687	I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth; and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!	1	189	42	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1688	Do you really think so?	2	189	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2767	Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.	6	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1689	Upon my word, I begin to be of your uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?	3	189	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1690	Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?	4	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1691	In the first place, there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.	5	189	42	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1692	Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.	6	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1693	Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.	7	189	42	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1694	But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.	8	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1695	But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?	9	189	42	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1696	It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed, that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.	10	189	20	replied	with tears in her eyes	f	f	f	f
1697	But you see that Jane does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.	11	189	37	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1698	Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.	12	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1699	And do you really know all this?	13	189	37	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1700	I do indeed. I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.	14	189	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1701	But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?	15	189	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1702	Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.	16	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1703	When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?	17	189	37	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1704	Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.	18	189	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1705	Not yet. But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.	1	190	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1706	Is my father in town?	2	190	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1707	Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.	3	190	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1708	And have you heard from him often?	4	190	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1709	We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.	5	190	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1710	And my mother—how is she? How are you all?	6	190	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2350	I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!	5	261	50	began	again	f	f	f	f
1711	My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.	7	190	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1712	But you—how are you? You look pale. How much you must have gone through!	8	190	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1713	If I had been able to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.	1	191	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1714	Do not give way to useless alarm; though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.	2	191	42	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1715	Oh! my dear brother, that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.	3	191	8	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1716	This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.	1	192	27	whisper	\N	f	f	f	f
1717	Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.	2	192	27	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1718	But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.	1	193	20	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1719	Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.	2	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1720	And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?	3	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1721	Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.	4	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1722	And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?	5	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1723	How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.	6	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1724	But not before they went to Brighton?	7	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1726	And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?	9	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1727	I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.	10	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1728	Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!	11	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1729	Perhaps it would have been better. But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.	12	193	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1730	Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his wife?	13	193	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1731	He brought it with him for us to see.	14	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1732	Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia! What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!	15	193	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1733	I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!	16	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1734	Oh! Jane, was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?	17	193	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1735	I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.	18	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1725	No, I believe not.	8	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2454	I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more.	8	268	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1737	Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if they should be of use to us.	20	193	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1738	She had better have stayed at home; perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.	21	193	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1739	He meant I believe to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.	22	193	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1740	A gamester! This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.	1	194	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1741	What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia? Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?	1	195	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1742	Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.	1	196	19	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1743	You must not be too severe upon yourself.	2	196	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1744	You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.	3	196	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1745	Do you suppose them to be in London?	4	196	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1746	Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?	5	196	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1747	And Lydia used to want to go to London.	6	196	21	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1748	She is happy then; and her residence there will probably be of some duration.	7	196	19	said	drily	f	f	f	f
1749	Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.	8	196	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1750	This is a parade which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.	9	196	19	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1751	I am not going to run away, papa. If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.	10	196	21	said	fretfully	f	f	f	f
1752	You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.	11	196	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1753	Well, well do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.	12	196	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1754	I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.	1	197	43	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1755	What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.	2	197	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1756	Dear madam, don’t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.	3	197	43	cried	in great astonishment	f	f	f	f
1757	If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the little copse.	4	197	44	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1758	Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?	1	198	20	cried out	eagerly	f	f	f	f
1759	Yes I have had a letter from him by express.	2	198	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1760	Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?	3	198	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1761	What is there of good to be expected? But perhaps you would like to read it.	4	198	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1762	Read it aloud, for I hardly know myself what it is about.	5	198	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1763	Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2. My dear Brother, At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both—	6	198	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1764	Then it is as I always hoped; they are married!	7	198	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1792	Well, it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.	3	201	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1794	Haye Park might do, if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.	1	202	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1795	Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.	2	202	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2574	My dear Emma, you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening.	8	282	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1765	I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., EDW. GARDINER.	8	198	20	read on	\N	f	f	f	f
1766	Is it possible? Can it be possible that he will marry her?	9	198	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1767	Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him. My dear father, I congratulate you.	10	198	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1768	And have you answered the letter?	11	198	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1769	No; but it must be done soon.	12	198	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1770	Oh! my dear father, come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.	13	198	19	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1771	Let me write for you, if you dislike the trouble yourself.	14	198	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1772	I dislike it very much; but it must be done.	15	198	19	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1773	And may I ask—; but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.	16	198	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1774	Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.	17	198	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1775	And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!	18	198	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1776	Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.	19	198	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1777	Money! My uncle!, what do you mean, sir?	20	198	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1778	I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.	21	198	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1779	That is very true; though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.	22	198	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1780	No; Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.	23	198	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1781	Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?	24	198	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1782	And they are really to be married! How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!	1	199	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1783	I comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?	2	199	25	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1784	If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!	3	199	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1785	We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side: I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.	4	199	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1786	Their conduct has been such as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.	5	199	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1787	Just as you please.	1	200	19	replied	coolly	f	f	f	f
1788	May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?	2	200	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1789	Take whatever you like, and get away.	3	200	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1790	My dear, dear Lydia! This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!	1	201	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1791	For we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.	2	201	25	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1793	I will go to Meryton as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.	4	201	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1796	She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——’s regiment.	1	203	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1797	Only think of its being three months since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.	1	204	22	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1798	Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.	2	204	22	continued	gaily	f	f	f	f
1799	Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.	1	205	22	say	\N	f	f	f	f
1800	Well, mamma, and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.	1	206	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1801	Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?	2	206	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1802	Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.	3	206	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1803	I should like it beyond anything!	4	206	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1804	And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.	5	206	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1805	I thank you for my share of the favour; but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.	6	206	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1806	Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?	1	207	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1807	No really; I think there cannot be too little said on the subject	2	207	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1808	La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	3	207	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1809	Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.	4	207	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1810	Mr. Darcy!	5	207	20	repeated	in utter amazement	f	f	f	f
1811	Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!	6	207	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1812	If it was to be secret, say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.	7	207	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1813	Oh! certainly; we will ask you no questions.	8	207	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1814	Thank you, for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.	9	207	22	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1815	I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?	1	208	34	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1816	You certainly do; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.	2	208	20	replied	with a smile	f	f	f	f
1817	I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better.	3	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1818	True. Are the others coming out?	4	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1819	I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.	5	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1820	I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.	6	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1821	Yes, she did.	7	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1822	And what did she say?	8	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1823	That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.	9	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1824	Certainly.	10	208	34	replied	biting his lips	f	f	f	f
1825	I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.	11	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1827	Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh. It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.	12	208	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1828	Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.	13	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1829	Yes; he introduced us to his sister.	14	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1830	And do you like her?	15	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1831	Very much.	16	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2814	You speak too plain. She must understand you.	12	301	48	whispering	\N	f	f	f	f
1832	I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.	17	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1833	I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.	18	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1834	Did you go by the village of Kympton?	19	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1835	I do not recollect that we did.	20	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1836	I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.	21	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1837	How should you have liked making sermons?	22	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1838	Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?	23	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1839	I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.	24	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1840	You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.	25	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1841	I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.	26	208	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1842	You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.	27	208	34	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1843	Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.	28	208	20	said in reply	with a good-humoured smile	f	f	f	f
1844	Oh! my dear Lydia, when shall we meet again?	1	209	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1845	Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.	2	209	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1846	Write to me very often, my dear.	3	209	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1847	As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.	4	209	22	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1848	He is as fine a fellow as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.	1	210	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1849	I often think that there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.	1	211	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1850	This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.	2	211	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1851	It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.	3	211	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1852	Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister. Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?	1	212	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1853	You may depend on it, for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.	2	212	45	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1854	I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people’s remarks.	1	213	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1855	As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear, you will wait on him of course.	1	214	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1856	No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.	2	214	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1857	’Tis an etiquette I despise. If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.	3	214	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1858	Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.	4	214	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1859	I begin to be sorry that he comes at all. It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!	1	215	25	said	to her sister	f	f	f	f
1860	I wish I could say anything to comfort you; but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.	2	215	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1861	There is a gentleman with him, mamma; who can it be?	1	216	21	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1862	Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.	2	216	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1863	La!, it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.	3	216	21	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1934	This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?	11	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2570	No; you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore.	4	282	49	said	nearly at the same time	f	f	f	f
2575	Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained.	9	282	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5640	No.	20	607	92	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1864	Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.	4	216	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1865	It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away.	1	217	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1866	I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?	2	217	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1867	It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married, but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.	3	217	8	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1868	When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley, I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.	4	217	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1869	You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley, for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.	5	217	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1870	Now that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.	1	218	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1871	Yes, very indifferent indeed. Oh, Jane, take care.	2	218	20	said	laughingly	f	f	f	f
1872	My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?	3	218	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1873	I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.	4	218	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1874	The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?	1	219	46	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
1875	Is your sister at Pemberley still?	1	220	20	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1876	Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.	2	220	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1877	And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?	3	220	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1878	Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.	4	220	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1879	Well girls, What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.	1	221	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1880	It has been a very agreeable day. The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.	1	222	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1881	Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.	2	222	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1882	You are very cruel, you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.	3	222	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1883	How hard it is in some cases to be believed!	4	222	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1884	And how impossible in others!	5	222	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1885	But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?	6	222	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1886	That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.	7	222	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1887	Next time you call, I hope we shall be more lucky.	1	223	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1888	Can you come to-morrow?	2	223	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1889	My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.	1	224	8	crying out	\N	f	f	f	f
1890	We will be down as soon as we can; but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.	2	224	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1891	Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?	3	224	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1892	What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?	1	225	21	said	very innocently	f	f	f	f
1893	Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.	2	225	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1894	Come here, my love, I want to speak to you.	3	225	8	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
1895	Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.	4	225	8	called out	\N	f	f	f	f
1896	We may as well leave them by themselves you know. Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.	5	225	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1897	’Tis too much! by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?	1	226	25	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1935	Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.	12	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2571	Miss Fairfax is reserved.	5	282	48	said	only	f	f	f	f
2576	I am disappointed.	10	282	49	answer	only	f	f	f	f
1898	I must go instantly to my mother. I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!	2	226	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1899	Where is your sister?	1	227	23	said	hastily	f	f	f	f
1900	With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.	2	227	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1901	Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.	1	228	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1902	You are a good girl; and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.	2	228	19	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1903	I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.	3	228	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1904	Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet, what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.	4	228	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1905	Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!	5	228	8	addressing	\N	f	f	f	f
1906	He has made me so happy by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.	1	229	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1907	I suspected as much. But how did he account for it?	2	229	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1908	It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.	3	229	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1909	That is the most unforgiving speech that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.	4	229	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1910	Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!	5	229	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1911	He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.	6	229	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1912	I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!	7	229	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1913	If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.	8	229	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1914	I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.	1	230	39	said	very stiffly	f	f	f	f
1915	And that I suppose is one of your sisters.	2	230	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1916	Yes, madam. She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.	3	230	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1917	You have a very small park here.	4	230	39	returned	after a short silence	f	f	f	f
1918	It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.	5	230	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1919	This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.	6	230	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1920	May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.	7	230	8	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1921	Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.	8	230	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1922	Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.	9	230	39	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1923	Go, my dear, and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.	10	230	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1924	You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.	1	231	39	began	in the following manner	f	f	f	f
1925	Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.	2	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1926	Miss Bennet, you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.	3	231	39	replied	in an angry tone	f	f	f	f
1927	If you believed it impossible to be true, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?	4	231	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1928	At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.	5	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1929	Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.	6	231	20	said	coolly	f	f	f	f
1930	If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?	7	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1931	I never heard that it was.	8	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1932	And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?	9	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1933	I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.	10	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1936	It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.	13	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1937	If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.	14	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1938	Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.	15	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1939	But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.	16	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1940	Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?	17	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1941	Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.	18	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1942	The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?	19	231	39	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1943	Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?	20	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1944	Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.	21	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1945	These are heavy misfortunes. But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.	22	231	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1946	Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.	23	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1947	That will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.	24	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1948	I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.	25	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1949	In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.	26	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1950	True. You are a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.	27	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1951	Whatever my connections may be, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.	28	231	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1952	Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?	29	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1953	I am not.	30	231	20	say	after a moment's deliberation	f	f	f	f
1954	And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?	31	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1955	I will make no promise of the kind.	32	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1956	Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.	33	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1957	And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.	34	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1958	Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband, who is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?	35	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1959	You can now have nothing further to say. You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.	36	231	20	answered	resentfully	f	f	f	f
1960	You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?	37	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1961	Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.	38	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1962	You are then resolved to have him?	39	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3388	Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!	16	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1963	I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.	40	231	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1964	It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.	41	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1965	Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.	42	231	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1966	And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.	43	231	39	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1967	I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.	44	231	39	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1968	She did not choose it, she would go.	1	232	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1969	She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?	2	232	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1970	Lizzy, I was going to look for you; come into my room.	1	233	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1971	I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.	2	233	19	said	then	f	f	f	f
1972	You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.	3	233	19	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
1973	From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?	4	233	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1974	Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.’	5	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1975	Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’	6	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1976	Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:	7	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1977	‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’	8	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1978	Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!	9	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1979	Are you not diverted?	10	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1980	Oh! yes. Pray read on.	11	233	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1981	‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?	12	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1982	Oh!, I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!	13	233	20	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
1983	Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?	14	233	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1984	Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.	1	234	20	said	immediately	f	f	f	f
1985	I am sorry, exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.	2	234	24	replied	in a tone of surprise and emotion	f	f	f	f
1986	You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.	3	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1987	If you will thank me, let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.	4	234	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1988	You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.	5	234	24	added	\N	f	f	f	f
1989	It taught me to hope as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.	6	234	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1990	Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.	7	234	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
1991	What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.	8	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1992	We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.	9	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1993	I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.	10	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1994	I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.	11	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1995	I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.	12	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1996	Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.	13	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
1997	Did it, did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?	14	234	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1998	I knew that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.	15	234	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
1999	The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.	16	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2000	When I wrote that letter, I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.	17	234	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2001	The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.	18	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2002	I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.	19	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2003	Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?	20	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2004	Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.	21	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2005	My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?	22	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2006	Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.	23	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2007	I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?	24	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2008	No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.	25	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2009	Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.	26	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2815	I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning.	13	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2010	My object then was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.	27	234	24	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2011	I must ask whether you were surprised?	28	234	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2012	Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.	29	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2013	That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.	30	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2014	On the evening before my going to London, I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.	31	234	24	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2015	Did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?	32	234	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2016	From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.	33	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2017	And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.	34	234	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2018	It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.	35	234	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2019	My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?	1	235	25	question	\N	f	f	f	f
2020	You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.	1	236	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2021	This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.	2	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2022	Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.	3	236	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2023	You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.	4	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2024	Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you. My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?	5	236	25	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2025	There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?	6	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2026	Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?	7	236	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2027	Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.	8	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2028	What do you mean?	9	236	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2029	Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.	10	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2030	My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?	11	236	25	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2031	It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.	12	236	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2032	Now I am quite happy, for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.	13	236	25	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2033	Good gracious!, if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.	1	237	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2034	Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?	1	238	23	said	aloud	f	f	f	f
2035	I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.	2	238	8	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2036	It may do very well for the others; but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?	3	238	23	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2037	I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.	4	238	8	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
2038	Go to your father, he wants you in the library.	1	239	24	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
2039	Lizzy, what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?	1	240	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2040	Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?	2	240	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2041	Have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference?	3	240	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2042	None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.	4	240	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2659	I certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.	18	287	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2043	I do, I do like him, I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.	5	240	20	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2044	Lizzy, I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.	6	240	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2045	Well, my dear, I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.	7	240	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2046	This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.	8	240	19	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2047	If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.	9	240	19	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
2048	Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.	1	241	8	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2049	My dearest child, I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.	2	241	8	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2050	I admire all my three sons-in-law highly. Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane’s.	1	242	19	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2051	How could you begin? I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?	1	243	20	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2052	I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.	2	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2053	My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?	3	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2054	For the liveliness of your mind, I did.	4	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2055	You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.	5	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2056	Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?	6	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2057	Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?	7	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2058	Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.	8	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2059	But I was embarrassed.	9	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2060	And so was I.	10	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2061	You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.	11	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2062	A man who had felt less, might.	12	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2063	How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.	13	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2064	You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.	14	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2065	Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?	15	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2066	My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.	16	243	24	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2067	Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?	17	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2660	Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?	19	287	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2069	And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.	19	243	20	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2070	Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!	1	244	47	say	exactly	f	f	f	f
2071	I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?	2	244	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2072	A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my dear.	3	244	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2074	How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.	4	244	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2075	My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far.	5	244	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2076	No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure.	6	244	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2077	The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?	7	244	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2078	They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!	8	244	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2079	I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are.	9	244	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2080	It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.	1	245	47	observed	gratefully	f	f	f	f
2081	Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.	2	245	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2082	But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold.	3	245	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2083	Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.	4	245	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2084	Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.	5	245	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2085	By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?	6	245	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2086	Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.	7	245	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2087	Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say ‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.	8	245	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2088	Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature! That is what you have in your head, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.	9	245	48	said	playfully	f	f	f	f
2089	I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed. I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.	10	245	47	said	with a sigh	f	f	f	f
2090	My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.	11	245	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2091	Emma knows I never flatter her, but I meant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a gainer.	12	245	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2092	Well—you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.	13	245	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2093	Dear Emma bears every thing so well. But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for.	14	245	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2094	It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion. We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married.	15	245	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2095	And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me, and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.	16	245	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2096	Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.	17	245	47	replied	fondly	f	f	f	f
2116	Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable.	10	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2232	I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper.	35	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2097	I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.	18	245	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2098	Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.	19	245	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2099	I do not understand what you mean by ‘success.'  Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said.	20	245	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2100	And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.	21	245	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2101	A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.	22	245	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2102	Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others. But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family circle grievously.	23	245	47	rejoined	\N	f	f	f	f
2103	Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service.	24	245	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2104	Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.	25	245	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2105	With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time, and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.	26	245	49	said	laughing	f	f	f	f
2106	Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of tart—a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you.	1	246	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2107	And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her.	1	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2108	Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business? He does not read?	2	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2109	Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats—but he reads all them to himself. But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.	3	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2110	What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?	4	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2111	Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know, after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has passed you very often.	5	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2112	That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.	6	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2113	To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.	7	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2114	I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine his age to be?	8	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2119	To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.	13	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2120	I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.	14	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2121	“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do.	15	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2122	You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter, without education.	16	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2123	To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.	17	247	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2118	Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.	12	247	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2124	Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?	1	248	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2125	He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.	2	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2126	To be sure, he is not so genteel as real gentlemen.	3	248	50	said	in a mortified voice	f	f	f	f
2127	I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.	4	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2128	Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!	5	248	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2129	Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with him. You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference.	6	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2130	Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.	7	248	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2131	Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston’s time of life?	8	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2132	There is no saying, indeed.	9	248	50	replied	rather solemnly	f	f	f	f
2133	But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss.	10	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2134	Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.	11	248	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2262	Come, I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was refused.	19	255	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2264	Oh! to be sure, it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.	21	255	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2345	I have no hesitation in saying; I have no hesitation in saying—at least if my friend feels at all as I do—I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.	4	260	52	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2351	My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all.	6	261	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2353	I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the question: and I do not wish to see any such person. I would rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.	8	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2135	How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will thrive, and be a very rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us.	12	248	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2136	I wonder he did not remember the book.	13	248	50	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
2137	In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr. Knightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?	14	248	48	beginning	\N	f	f	f	f
2138	I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.	1	249	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2139	A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?	2	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2140	I think they will neither of them do the other any good.	3	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2141	You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley.	4	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2142	Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.	5	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2143	Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.	6	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2144	Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists they were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.	7	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2145	I dare say that I thought so then;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omitting to do any thing I wished.	8	249	51	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2146	There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that.	9	249	49	said	feelingly	f	f	f	f
2147	But I, who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.	10	249	49	added	soon	f	f	f	f
2148	I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.	11	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2149	Yes. You are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.	12	249	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2150	Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston.	13	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2151	Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.	14	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2152	I hope not that.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter.	15	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2178	What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her picture!	3	251	48	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
2263	Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl about?	20	255	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2265	Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.	22	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2153	Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma’s genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They only give a little polish.	16	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2154	I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!	17	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2155	Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.	18	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2156	Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?	19	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2157	I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old friend.	20	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2158	Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’ now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?	21	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2159	I have not a fault to find with her person. I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.	22	249	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2160	And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times.	23	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2161	Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions with me.	24	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2162	I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.	25	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2163	Not at all; I am much obliged to you for it. It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.	26	249	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2164	Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister.	27	249	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2165	Be satisfied, I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!	28	249	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2166	So do I, very much.	29	249	51	said	gently	f	f	f	f
2167	She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.	30	249	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2168	There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present; as can well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse’s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.	31	249	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2169	You have given Miss Smith all that she required; you have made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.	1	250	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2170	I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little.	2	250	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2171	If it were admissible to contradict a lady--	3	250	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2172	I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.	4	250	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2173	Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!	5	250	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2174	Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable.	6	250	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2175	I have no doubt of it.	7	250	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2176	Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?: did you ever sit for your picture?	1	251	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2177	Oh! dear, no, never.	2	251	50	say	with a very interesting naïveté	f	f	f	f
2179	Let me entreat you; it would indeed be a delight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?	4	251	52	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2180	Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.	5	251	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2181	Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.	6	251	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2182	But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be drawn?’	7	251	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2183	Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.	8	251	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2184	No great variety of faces for you. I had only my own family to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her. There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last, my last and my best—my brother, Mr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but that was a fault on the right side-Yes, it was a little like—but to be sure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my resolution now.	9	251	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2185	No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives	10	251	52	repeating	\N	f	f	f	f
2186	By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party.	11	251	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2187	Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted. he expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of her face that she has them not.	1	252	51	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
2188	Do you think so? I cannot agree with you. It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.	2	252	52	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2189	You have made her too tall, Emma.	3	252	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2190	Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short gives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!	4	252	52	added	warmly	f	f	f	f
2191	It is very pretty. So prettily done! Just as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.	5	252	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2192	But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree.	6	252	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2193	But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.	7	252	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2194	You, sir, may say any thing, but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of Miss Smith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.	8	252	52	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2195	Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.	9	252	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2196	What a precious deposit!	10	252	52	said	with a tender sigh	f	f	f	f
2197	Upon my word, the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.	1	253	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2198	Will you read the letter? Pray do. II’d rather you would.	2	253	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2199	Well, well.	3	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2200	Is it a good letter? or is it too short?	4	253	50	add	\N	f	f	f	f
2201	Yes, indeed, a very good letter--so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet, than I had expected.	5	253	48	replied	rather slowly	f	f	f	f
2202	Well—well—and—and what shall I do?	6	253	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2203	What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?	7	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2204	Yes.	8	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2205	But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and speedily.	9	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2206	Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.	10	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2266	I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.	23	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2207	Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.	11	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2208	You think I ought to refuse him then.	12	253	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2209	Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.	13	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2210	You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.	14	253	48	continued	with a little reserve of manner	f	f	f	f
2211	No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.	15	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2212	I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.	16	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2213	I had no notion that he liked me so very much.	17	253	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2214	I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say ‘No’ directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence you.	18	253	48	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2215	Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘No,’ perhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘No?’	19	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2216	Not for the world would I advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking of?	20	253	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2217	Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?	21	253	50	said	with some hesitation	f	f	f	f
2218	Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever.	22	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2219	You could not have visited me! No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.	23	253	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2220	Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I must have given you up.	24	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2221	Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!	25	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2222	Dear affectionate creature!—You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must have a pretty good opinion of himself.	26	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2223	I do not think he is conceited either, in general; at least, he is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.	27	253	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2224	Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.	28	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2225	Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.	29	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2227	very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter.	30	253	48	pass	\N	f	f	f	f
2228	Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But how shall I do? What shall I say?	31	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2229	I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again.	32	253	50	said	in rather a sorrowful tone	f	f	f	f
2230	Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.	33	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2231	And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield.	34	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2267	You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.	24	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2347	Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.	2	261	50	remark	\N	f	f	f	f
2352	Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.	7	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2354	Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!	9	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2661	Ever hear her! You forget how much she belongs to Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began. She plays charmingly.	20	287	48	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
6139	I did.	85	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2233	One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves.	36	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2234	Now he has got my letter. I wonder what they are all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.	37	253	50	said	softly	f	f	f	f
2235	Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed. At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.	38	253	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2236	My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.	39	253	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2237	Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!	40	253	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2238	Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.	1	254	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2239	My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.	2	254	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2240	I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns—my winter walk.	3	254	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2241	You cannot do better, sir.	4	254	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2242	I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.	5	254	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2243	Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you.	6	254	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2244	I cannot rate her beauty as you do; but she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.	1	255	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2245	I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.	2	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2246	Come, you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s giggle; she really does you credit.	3	255	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2247	Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it.	4	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2248	You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?	5	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2249	Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended.	6	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2250	Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.	7	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2251	Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!	8	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2252	Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.	9	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2253	I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage.	10	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2254	Indeed! how so? of what sort?	11	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2255	A very serious sort, I assure you.	12	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2256	Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?	13	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2257	I have reason to think that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.	14	255	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2258	He is very obliging; but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?	15	255	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2259	Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.	16	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2260	Pray, Mr. Knightley, how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?	17	255	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2261	Certainly, I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?	18	255	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3378	Had you any idea of his being in love with her?—You, perhaps, might.—You who can see into every body’s heart; but nobody else—	6	354	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3409	We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come.	10	355	51	ended with	\N	f	f	f	f
2268	And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.	25	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2269	Not Harriet’s equal!	26	255	49	exclaimed	loudly and warmly	f	f	f	f
2270	No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even your satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.’	27	255	49	added	with calmer asperity	f	f	f	f
2271	I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet’s claims. They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a degradation.	28	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2272	A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!	29	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2273	As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.	30	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2274	Whoever might be her parents, whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard’s line, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had encouragement.	31	255	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2275	You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.	32	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2276	Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.	33	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2277	To be sure! I know that is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives? No—pray let her have time to look about her.	33	255	48	cried	playfully	f	f	f	f
2312	The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know, because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its meaning change. But take it away, and all appropriation ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you.	24	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2816	But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.	14	301	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2278	I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy, though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.	35	255	49	said	presently	f	f	f	f
2279	We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry. But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.	36	255	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2280	Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked! Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.	37	255	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2281	Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.	38	255	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2282	Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s. He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.	39	255	49	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2283	I am very much obliged to you. If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.	40	255	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2284	Good morning to you.	41	255	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2285	that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.	1	256	53	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2286	Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?; that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you.	1	257	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2287	Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse--or Miss Smith could inspire him.	2	257	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2288	I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection. Being my friend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.	1	258	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2289	Take it--it is for you. Take your own.	1	259	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2290	What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman? And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.  Can it be Neptune? Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!  Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?	2	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2291	Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen. For Miss ———, read Miss Smith. My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.  That is court. Another view of man, my second brings;     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!  That is ship;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream. But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse we have!     Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown. Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.  A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you.	3	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2314	Very well; a most natural feeling; and the longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him.	26	259	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2348	I do not often walk this way now, but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of Highbury.	3	261	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2292	There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton’s intentions. You are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us.	4	259	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2293	Dear Miss Woodhouse!	5	259	50	articulate	at first	f	f	f	f
2294	Whatever you say is always right, and therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about him. He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss ———.’ Dear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?	6	259	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2295	I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose.	7	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2296	It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take place!	8	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2297	When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form. You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow. The course of true love never did run smooth—  A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.	9	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2298	That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.	10	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2299	This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them.	11	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2300	Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any thing like it.	12	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2301	I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it yesterday.	13	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2302	I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.	14	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2303	I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.	15	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2304	It is as long again as almost all we have had before.	16	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2305	I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things in general cannot be too short.	17	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2306	It is one thing to have very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like this.	18	259	50	said	presently	f	f	f	f
2307	Such sweet lines!--these two last!—But how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?	19	259	50	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2308	Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.	20	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2309	Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.	21	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2310	Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book.	22	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2311	Oh! but those two lines are	23	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2313	I shall never let that book go out of my own hands.	25	259	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2344	You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s approbation while he writes with such gallantry.	3	260	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2349	I wish we could contrive it; but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper—no message from my father.	4	261	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2475	I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case; but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.	5	271	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2763	Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her’s, than a lamp is like sunshine.	2	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6143	Intimately.	93	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2315	My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.	27	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2316	Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.	28	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2317	Well, my dears, how does your book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?	29	259	47	inquiry	very frequent	f	f	f	f
2318	Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in.	30	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2319	Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true. ‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, Emma.	31	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2320	Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several. Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,     Kindled a flame I yet deplore, The hood-wink’d boy I called to aid, Though of his near approach afraid,     So fatal to my suit before.  And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.	32	259	47	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2321	Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick’s, you know.	33	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2322	Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it. Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.  The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what room there will be for the children?	34	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2323	Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you know. Why should there be any change?	35	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2324	I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley’s being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!	36	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2325	She will not be surprized, papa, at least.	37	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2326	I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married.	38	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2327	We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.	39	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2328	Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.	40	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2329	It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.	41	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2330	It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield.	42	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2331	But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.	43	259	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2332	Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband.	44	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2333	Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?	45	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2334	Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.	46	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2335	I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.	47	259	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2336	Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?’ and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with them very often.	48	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2337	He appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of him.	49	259	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2338	And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!	50	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2339	But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.	51	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2340	Well, I cannot understand it.	52	259	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2341	That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.	53	259	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2342	Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines.	1	260	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2343	honour	2	260	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2346	There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.	1	261	48	remark	\N	f	f	f	f
2355	I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.	10	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2356	But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!	11	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2357	That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.	12	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2358	But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!	13	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2359	Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.	14	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2360	Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?	15	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2361	If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.	16	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2362	Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times—but are you acquainted?	17	261	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2363	Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.	18	261	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2364	These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?	1	262	48	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2365	Very true. Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else.	2	262	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2366	And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over. I do not think it will.	3	262	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2367	Oh! dear, no.	4	262	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2368	Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.	5	262	48	say	farther	f	f	f	f
2369	Oh! dear, yes.	6	262	50	answer	just	f	f	f	f
2370	Part of my lace is gone, and I do not know how I am to contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.	1	263	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2371	Ah, my dear, poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous business.	1	264	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2372	Oh yes, sir, how you must miss her! And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty well, sir.	2	264	54	cried	with ready sympathy	f	f	f	f
2373	Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably.	3	264	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2374	Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.	4	264	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2375	Very much to the honour of both.	5	264	55	reply	handsome	f	f	f	f
2376	And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?	6	264	54	asked	in the plaintive tone which just suited her father	f	f	f	f
2377	Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.	7	264	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2399	That’s true, very true. Little Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good intentions went, we were both right, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.	9	265	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2628	I hope I should know better; no, depend upon it, that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms.	7	285	60	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2378	Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which is the exact truth.	8	264	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2379	Just as it should be, and just as I hoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.	9	264	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2380	Why, to be sure, yes, certainly—I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.	10	264	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2381	It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.	11	264	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2382	I think, indeed, that Mr. Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.	12	264	55	said	pleasantly	f	f	f	f
2383	Me, my love. Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.	13	264	54	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2384	Where is the young man? Has he been here on this occasion—or has he not?	14	264	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2385	He has not been here yet. There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.	15	264	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2386	But you should tell them of the letter, my dear. He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—	16	264	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2387	My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.	17	264	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2388	Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on; and it was signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that perfectly.	18	264	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3379	Upon my word, I begin to doubt my having any such talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.	7	354	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2389	How very pleasing and proper of him! I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is something so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him. To give up one’s child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.	19	264	54	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2390	Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy. But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.	20	264	55	observed	coolly	f	f	f	f
2391	What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.	1	265	48	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
2392	If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.	2	265	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2393	To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.	3	265	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2394	Yes--and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born.	4	265	49	said	smiling	f	f	f	f
2395	A material difference then--and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?	5	265	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2396	Yes—a good deal nearer.	6	265	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2397	But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently.	7	265	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2398	I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.	8	265	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2400	A man cannot be more so.	10	265	49	answer	short, full	f	f	f	f
2401	Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me.	11	265	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2402	My poor dear Isabella--How long it is, how terribly long since you were here! And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.	1	266	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2403	It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.	2	266	47	say	with an air of grave reflection	f	f	f	f
2404	Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.	3	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2405	Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.	4	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2406	Come, come, I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.	5	266	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2407	Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?	6	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2408	Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.	7	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2409	And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones.	8	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2410	I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.	9	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2411	Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.	10	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2412	It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have spoken to—	11	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2413	You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates, I have not heard one inquiry after them.	12	266	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2414	Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs. Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They are always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?	13	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2415	Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago.	14	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2416	How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.	15	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2417	That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.	16	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2418	No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except—	17	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2419	Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the air so bad!	18	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2420	No, indeed—we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is very superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.	19	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2421	Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present.	20	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2422	I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill.	21	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2423	Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well.	22	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2424	What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?	23	266	55	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3410	Are you well, my Emma?	11	355	51	question	parting	f	f	f	f
2425	I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home.	24	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2426	My dear Isabella--pray do not concern yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.	25	266	47	exclaimed	hastily	f	f	f	f
2427	I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend Mr. Graham’s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?	26	266	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2451	Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.	5	268	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2453	I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.	7	268	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2428	That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax! It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always regret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.	27	266	54	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2429	Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet.	28	266	47	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2430	I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.	29	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2431	Ah!	30	266	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2432	I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.	31	266	47	began with	\N	f	f	f	f
2433	But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.	32	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2434	And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.	33	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2435	I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.	34	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2436	You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have consulted Perry.	35	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2437	But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.	36	266	54	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2438	Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very ill-judged measure.	37	266	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2439	Mr. Perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than his drugs.	38	266	55	said	in a voice of very strong displeasure	f	f	f	f
2440	If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.	39	266	55	added	with only sarcastic dryness	f	f	f	f
2441	True, true--very true. That’s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.	40	266	49	cried	with most ready interposition	f	f	f	f
2442	a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.	1	267	48	describing	\N	f	f	f	f
2443	A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks. Why does not Perry see her?	2	267	52	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
2444	It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.	3	267	48	added	soon afterwards--as if quite another subject	f	f	f	f
2445	very cold, certainly very cold	4	267	52	acknowledgment	muttering	f	f	f	f
2446	You do quite right--we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.	5	267	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2447	I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature works.	1	268	55	began with	\N	f	f	f	f
2448	Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect; but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.	2	268	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2449	Yes, he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.	3	268	55	said	presently, with some slyness	f	f	f	f
2450	Me!, are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton’s object?	4	268	48	replied	with a sense of astonishment	f	f	f	f
2452	Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!	6	268	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3380	Me! Why should you caution me?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.	8	354	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3389	My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of it is strong on my memory.	17	354	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3416	If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already.	5	356	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2455	A man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s not staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow. Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home.	1	269	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2456	Much the same—not better.	1	270	52	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
2457	My report from Mrs. Goddard’s was not so pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was my answer.	2	270	48	said	presently	f	f	f	f
2458	Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.	3	270	52	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
2459	My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you probably heard.	4	270	48	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
2460	Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—	5	270	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2461	He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!	6	270	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2462	Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.	7	270	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2463	What an excellent device, the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha! snows a little I see.	8	270	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2464	Yes, and I think we shall have a good deal of it.	9	270	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2465	Christmas weather. Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se’nnight.	10	270	52	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
2466	I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.	11	270	55	said	only, coolly	f	f	f	f
2467	We are sure of excellent fires, and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.	12	270	52	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2468	I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with any body.	13	270	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2469	Indeed! I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment.	14	270	52	\N	in a tone of wonder and pity	f	f	f	f
2470	My first enjoyment will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.	15	270	55	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2471	“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a fortnight.	1	271	56	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2472	He has been wanting to come to us ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.	2	271	56	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2473	What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself.	3	271	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2474	Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank’s coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.	4	271	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3417	How is it possible?	6	356	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2476	Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her way—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.	6	271	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2477	for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?	1	272	51	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2478	Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.	2	272	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2479	My Emma! what is the certainty of caprice?	3	272	51	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2480	You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.	4	272	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2481	Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill: and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!	5	272	54	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2482	And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.	1	273	48	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
2483	Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.	2	273	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2484	He ought to come. If he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having it in his power to do as much as that. A young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young man’s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it.	3	273	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2485	One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he can do. One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.	4	273	51	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2486	But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.	5	273	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2487	My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be.	6	273	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2488	I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes.	7	273	48	said	coolly	f	f	f	f
2489	He may have a great deal of influence on some points, and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.	8	273	51	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2490	Would not she give him her support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain that Miss Smith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?	1	274	52	implore	\N	f	f	f	f
2491	So scrupulous for others, and yet so careless for herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.	2	274	52	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2492	This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.	3	274	55	concluding	\N	f	f	f	f
2493	I admired your resolution very much, sir, in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.	4	274	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2494	What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?	5	274	47	exclamation	first	f	f	f	f
2495	You had better order the carriage directly, my love; I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.	6	274	54	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2496	Indeed! Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.	7	274	55	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2497	Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?	8	274	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2498	I am ready, if the others are.	9	274	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2499	Shall I ring the bell?	10	274	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2500	Yes, do.	11	274	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2988	I have often thought them the worst of the two. Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.	9	319	55	replied	coolly	f	f	f	f
2501	He was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind. He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together as they could	1	275	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2502	I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget yourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please.	1	276	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2503	Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!	2	276	52	repeated	with such assurance of accent	f	f	f	f
2504	Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.	3	276	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2505	It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.	4	276	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2506	Good Heaven! what can be the meaning of this?—Miss Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be insinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.	5	276	52	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2507	Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.	6	276	52	exclaimed	joyously	f	f	f	f
2508	No, sir, it confesses no such thing. So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther from my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?	7	276	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2509	Never, madam: never, I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received—	8	276	52	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2510	Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.	9	276	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2511	Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?	1	277	47	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2512	The Churchills are very likely in fault; but I dare say he might come if he would.	1	278	49	said	coolly	f	f	f	f
2513	I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.	2	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2514	I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.	3	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2515	How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?	4	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2516	I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is he?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible.	5	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2517	That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage.	6	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2518	It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want money—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the Churchills.	7	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2519	Yes, sometimes he can.	8	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2520	And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure.	9	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2521	It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.	10	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2629	He must be going. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.	8	285	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2522	There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going.	11	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2523	No; but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for him!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?	12	278	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2524	Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his.	13	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2525	I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.	14	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2526	Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.	15	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2527	Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life.	16	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2528	Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.	17	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2529	We shall never agree about him; but that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man: I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.	18	278	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2530	Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father’s having any right to complain. His letters disgust me.	19	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2531	Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.	20	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2532	I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s place, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him.	21	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2533	You seem determined to think ill of him.	22	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2534	Me!—not at all; I do not want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.	23	278	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2535	Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a sensation his coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else.	24	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2536	You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.	25	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2572	I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.	6	282	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2537	My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my idea of him.	26	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2538	And mine is, that if he turn out any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the practised politician, who is to read every body’s character, and make every body’s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point.	27	278	49	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
2539	I will say no more about him, you turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.	28	278	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2540	Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.	29	278	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2541	But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.	30	278	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2542	He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to another.	31	278	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2543	Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!	1	279	50	\N	very plaintive	f	f	f	f
2544	Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.	1	280	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2545	Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well, that is quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’	1	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2546	Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?	2	281	48	say	with smiling interest	f	f	f	f
2547	Thank you. You are so kind! Oh! here it is. I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two pages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t you, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done too!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’	3	281	57	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2548	You are extremely kind; you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma’am, do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane’s handwriting?	4	281	57	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2549	My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me. Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.	5	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2550	Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?	6	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2551	Oh yes; next week.	7	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2552	Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.	8	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2553	Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.	9	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2554	Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.	10	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2567	A very pleasant evening--particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother’s, it must have been a real indulgence.	1	282	49	began	\N	f	f	f	f
2573	You think her diffident. I do not see it.	7	282	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2764	Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played.	3	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2555	So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My mother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr. Dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.	11	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2556	You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.	12	281	48	said	with the insidious design of farther discovery	f	f	f	f
2557	Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!	13	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2558	But, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?	14	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2559	Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.	15	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2560	I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.	16	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2561	Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.	17	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2562	Yes, that of course.	18	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2563	Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so considerate!—But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.	19	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2564	It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.	20	281	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2565	And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will find from Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her illness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’—which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.	21	281	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2566	I am afraid we must be running away--My father will be expecting us. I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning.	22	281	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2568	I am happy you approved; but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.	2	282	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2569	No, my dear; that I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.	3	282	47	said	instantly	f	f	f	f
2577	I hope every body had a pleasant evening. I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.	11	282	47	said	in his quiet way	f	f	f	f
2578	True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.	12	282	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2579	She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.	13	282	48	said	with a sincerity which no one could question	f	f	f	f
2580	It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can venture to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other pork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my dear?	14	282	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2581	My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.	15	282	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2582	That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.	16	282	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2583	Emma, I have a piece of news for you. You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you.	17	282	49	said	presently	f	f	f	f
2584	News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?	18	282	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2585	No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls.	19	282	49	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2586	Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse—I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be married.	20	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2587	There is my news:—I thought it would interest you.	21	282	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2588	But where could you hear it? Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more than five—or at least ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out—I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork—Jane was standing in the passage—were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’ said I—well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—	22	282	57	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2589	I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just read Elton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.	23	282	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2590	Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.	24	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2591	We consider our Hartfield pork--indeed it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than—	25	282	47	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2592	Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say that ‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well—	26	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2593	It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of course. He had been so fortunate as to—I forget the precise words—one has no business to remember them. The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just settled.	27	282	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2594	Mr. Elton going to be married! He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.	28	282	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2595	He is very young to settle. He had better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.	29	282	47	observation	\N	f	f	f	f
2596	A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!; my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.	30	282	57	said	joyfully	f	f	f	f
2597	No—I have never seen Mr. Elton; is he—is he a tall man?	31	282	58	replied	\N	t	f	f	f
2598	Who shall answer that question? My father would say ‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.	32	282	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2626	Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for; but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.	5	285	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2627	You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings; were you to guess her to be eighteen, I should listen with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman.	6	285	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2658	You get upon delicate subjects, Emma; remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a little farther off.	17	287	51	said	smiling	f	f	f	f
2765	Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax’s is much beyond it.	4	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2599	Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young man—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much, but she does not hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He fancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It is such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir, I think there are few places with such society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—	33	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2600	As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted with her, nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.	34	282	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2601	You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.	35	282	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2602	When I have seen Mr. Elton, I dare say I shall be interested—but I believe it requires that with me. And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn off.	36	282	58	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2603	Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse, four weeks yesterday.—A Miss Hawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I immediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man—but’—In short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and with that sort of look—and not very talkative.	37	282	57	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2604	Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.	38	282	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2605	Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?	39	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2606	Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was plain.	40	282	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2607	My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain, and that you yourself—	41	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2608	Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain.	42	282	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2609	Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain.	43	282	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2610	It might be distressing, for the moment; but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it.	1	283	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2611	very true	2	283	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2612	would not think about it	3	283	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2613	master nor mistress was at home	1	284	59	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2614	This is too bad. And now we shall just miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so disappointed.	2	284	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2615	How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father—glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a letter this morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.	3	284	56	accosted	immediately	f	f	f	f
2616	I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield.	4	284	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2617	We had better move on, Mr. Weston, we are detaining the girls.	5	284	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2618	Well, well, I am ready, but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:	6	284	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2619	Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock.	7	284	51	injunction	parting	f	f	f	f
2620	Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three.	8	284	56	amendment	quick	f	f	f	f
2621	Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?	9	284	48	question	\N	f	f	f	f
2622	I told you yesterday, I told you all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.	1	285	56	cried	with exultation	f	f	f	f
2623	It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it, though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing.	2	285	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2624	Was she a horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large neighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There were several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they balls?—Was it a musical society?	3	285	60	inquiries	\N	f	f	f	f
2625	His father’s marriage had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.	4	285	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2657	Yes—I believe I do.	16	287	60	\N	rather hestitatingly	f	f	f	f
3381	I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject; but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?	9	354	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2630	As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name—I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?	9	285	60	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
2631	To be sure we do; Mrs. Bates—we passed her house—I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is. Call upon her, by all means.	10	285	56	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2632	There is no necessity for my calling this morning; another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which—	11	285	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2633	Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided. You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.	12	285	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2634	I have heard her speak of the acquaintance; she is a very elegant young woman.	13	285	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2635	Yes.	14	285	60	\N	quiet	f	f	f	f
2636	If you were never particularly struck by her manners before, I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.	15	285	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2637	You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?; then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way.	16	285	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2638	My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.	17	285	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2639	But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street.	18	285	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2640	My good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump.	19	285	56	calling out	\N	f	f	f	f
2641	He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.	1	286	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2642	Yes, oh! yes; I was just going to mention it. A very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him—but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.	1	287	60	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2643	And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?	2	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2644	Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most deplorable want of complexion.	3	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2645	It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face.	4	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2646	Well, there is no disputing about taste.—At least you admire her except her complexion.	5	287	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2647	I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion.	6	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2648	Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?	7	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2649	Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at Ford’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say they sell gloves.	8	287	60	exclaimed	hastily	f	f	f	f
2650	Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because you were Mr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.	9	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2651	But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life.	10	287	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2652	I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth.	11	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2653	And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.	12	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2654	Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.	13	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2655	May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all.	14	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2656	You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?	15	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2662	You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to her—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.	21	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2663	Proof indeed! Mr. Dixon is very musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.	22	287	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2664	Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof.	23	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2665	Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?	24	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2666	It was her very particular friend, you know.	25	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2667	Poor comfort! One would rather have a stranger preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.	26	287	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2668	You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it.	27	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2669	So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction.	28	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2670	As to that—I do not—	29	287	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2671	Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.	30	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2672	There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—	31	287	60	began	rather quickly	f	f	f	f
2673	however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.	32	287	60	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2674	I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve—I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.	33	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2675	It is a most repulsive quality, indeed. Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.	34	287	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2676	Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.	35	287	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2677	all young people would have their little whims.	1	288	51	comment	\N	f	f	f	f
2678	I am not fond of dinner-visiting--I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.	1	289	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2679	Well, sir, as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.	2	289	56	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2680	He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.	3	289	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2681	You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over.	4	289	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2682	But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?	5	289	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2683	Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.	6	289	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2684	But, my dear sir, if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.	7	289	56	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2685	And no great harm if it does. The sooner every party breaks up, the better.	8	289	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3382	Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?	10	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2686	But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person’s in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years.	9	289	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2687	No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.	10	289	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2688	Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit up.	11	289	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2689	This is coming as you should do; like a gentleman.—I am quite glad to see you.	1	290	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2690	How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.	2	290	49	observing	\N	f	f	f	f
2691	Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. Now you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.	3	290	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2692	Nonsensical girl!	4	290	49	reply	not at all in anger	f	f	f	f
2693	One can suppose nothing else, and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse to surprize her.	1	291	61	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2694	I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.	2	291	61	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2695	Why do you smile?	3	291	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2696	Nay, why do you?	4	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2697	Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s being so rich and so liberal.—It is a handsome present.	5	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2698	Very.	6	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2699	I rather wonder that it was never made before.	7	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2700	Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.	8	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2701	Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.	9	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2702	That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates’s house.	10	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2703	You may say what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.	11	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2704	I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?	12	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2705	What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?	13	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2706	Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.	14	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2707	If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon in them.	15	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2708	Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.	16	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2731	Very likely--nothing more likely. I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.	6	296	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2766	Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.	5	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2709	Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body’s native air do for them in the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are.	17	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2710	And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s preference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very decided.	18	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2711	And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.	19	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2712	He did. I was there—one of the party.	20	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2713	Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I should have made some discoveries.	21	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2714	I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries.	22	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2715	The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.	23	291	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2716	And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells.	24	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2717	No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.	25	291	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2718	Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.	26	291	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2719	He had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.	1	292	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2720	Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.	1	293	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2721	I have made a most wretched discovery. I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I hate the recollection.	1	294	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2722	Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut.	2	294	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2723	No, that is no subject of regret at all. I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen.	3	294	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2724	What is the matter?	1	295	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2725	Thank you for rousing me. I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own. I see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I will—and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she colours.	2	295	60	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2726	This is the luxury of a large party: one can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?	1	296	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2727	How?—They were invited, were not they?	2	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2728	Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their coming?	3	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2729	They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?	4	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2730	Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.	5	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2732	Well, you give him credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it?	7	296	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2733	Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax! Dear Mrs. Weston, how could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr. Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.	8	296	48	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
2734	My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?	9	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2735	Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr. Knightley marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!	10	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2736	Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know.	11	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2737	But the imprudence of such a match!	12	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2738	I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.	13	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2739	I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so mad a thing.	14	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2740	Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.	15	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2741	But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother’s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his time or his heart.	16	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2742	My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax—	17	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2743	Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—	18	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2744	Well, perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.	19	296	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2745	If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat. ‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it would last a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.’	20	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2746	For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety about her health—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love.	21	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2747	Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.	22	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2748	I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him.	23	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2749	Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so.	24	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2750	There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.	25	296	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2751	You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.	26	296	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2752	I often feel concern that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose.	1	297	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2753	Quite out of the question, quite out of the question; but you must often wish it, I am sure.	2	297	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2754	This present from the Campbells--this pianoforte is very kindly given.	3	297	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2755	Yes. But they would have done better had they given her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.	4	297	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2756	That will do--you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.	5	297	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2757	One more;—they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.	6	297	62	begged	\N	f	f	f	f
2758	I think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the song falls on the second.	7	297	60	say	\N	f	f	f	f
2759	That fellow thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice. This must not be.	8	297	49	said	indignantly	f	f	f	f
2760	Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on her.	9	297	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2761	Perhaps it is as well. I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.	1	298	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2768	Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?	7	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2769	Just as they always do—very vulgar.	8	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2770	They told me something; but it is nothing of any consequence.	9	299	50	said	rather hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
2771	They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.	10	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2772	Oh!	11	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2773	He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to dinner.	12	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2774	Oh!	13	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2775	They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer.	14	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2776	She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be.	15	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2777	She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him.	16	299	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2778	Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury.	17	299	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2779	For my companion tells me that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am going now.	18	299	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2780	And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope, to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if you are going home.	19	299	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2781	I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.	20	299	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2782	Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to do?	21	299	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2783	I am here on no business of my own; I am only waiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.	22	299	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2784	Well—if you advise it.—But if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.	23	299	60	\N	with a smile	f	f	f	f
2785	I do not believe any such thing. I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last night.	24	299	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2786	Do come with me, if it be not very disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.	25	299	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2787	Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?	1	300	63	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
3383	Harriet!—What do you mean?—Good Heaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—	11	354	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3390	Oh, dear, now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the gipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr. Knightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth.	18	354	50	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3396	Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.	24	354	50	rejected	with spirit	f	f	f	f
3403	Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she continued, ‘that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.’	4	355	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3411	Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.	12	355	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3418	I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.	7	356	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2789	It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels.	3	300	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2790	No more it is.	4	300	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2791	No trouble in the world, ma’am.	5	300	63	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2792	Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not know—No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?	6	300	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2793	That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.	7	300	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2794	Aye, that will be much best, I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.	8	300	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2795	My dear Miss Woodhouse, I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.	9	300	57	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2796	I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—	10	300	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3391	Good God!, this has been a most unfortunate—most deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?	19	354	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3397	I never should have presumed to think of it at first, but for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be the rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful.	25	354	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3404	Poor girl! She loves him then excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her judgment.	5	355	48	said	again	f	f	f	f
3412	He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.	1	356	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2788	Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?	2	300	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2797	Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s opinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said he, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet came out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had no use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really eats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us.	11	300	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2798	very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.	12	300	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2799	How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.	13	300	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2800	What was I talking of?	14	300	57	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2801	I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So I begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted to keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware.	15	300	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2802	Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning.	16	300	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2803	This is a pleasure, coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.	1	301	60	said	in rather a low voice	f	f	f	f
2804	What!, have not you finished it yet? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.	2	301	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2805	I have not been working uninterruptedly, I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.	3	301	60	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2806	Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ, the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you think so?	4	301	60	said	with a smile at Emma	f	f	f	f
2807	It is not fair; mine was a random guess. Do not distress her.	5	301	48	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
2808	How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?	6	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2809	Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell, I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be all conjecture.	7	301	48	said	in a voice of forced calmness	f	f	f	f
2810	Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at work, if one talks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.	8	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2811	If you are very kind, it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever has to give—for another half-hour.	9	301	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2812	What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.	10	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2813	Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.	11	301	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2817	I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does wrong, she ought to feel it.	15	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2818	She is not entirely without it, I think.	16	301	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2819	I do not see much sign of it. She is playing Robin Adair at this moment—his favourite.	17	301	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2820	Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!—Our little room so honoured!	1	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2821	How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.	2	302	57	began	\N	f	f	f	f
2822	How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.	3	302	49	say	most resolutely and commandingly	f	f	f	f
2823	So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage.	4	302	57	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
2824	I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?	5	302	49	cut her short	\N	f	f	f	f
2825	Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston.	6	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2826	Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for you?	7	302	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2827	No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.	8	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2828	Well, for five minutes, perhaps.	9	302	49	said	in a deliberating manner	f	f	f	f
2829	And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful; so many friends!	10	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2830	No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.	11	302	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2831	Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.	12	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2832	No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte.	13	302	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2833	Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any thing equal to it.	14	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2834	Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.	15	302	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2835	Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!	16	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2836	What is the matter now?	17	302	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2837	To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....	18	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2838	Yes, we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.	19	302	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2839	Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must have heard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at Kingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.	20	302	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2840	You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five. And there will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.	1	303	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2841	But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think there will.	2	303	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2842	And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it. It will not do to invite five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.	3	303	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2843	Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?	4	303	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2844	Oh no!; it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!	5	303	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2845	We were too magnificent. We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well.	6	303	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2846	It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?	7	303	48	demurred	\N	f	f	f	f
2847	Very true; it was very bad.	8	303	60	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
2848	I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.	9	303	60	ended	\N	f	f	f	f
2849	No, no, you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!	10	303	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2850	There is no denying it. I agree with you exactly. A crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know that—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.	11	303	60	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2851	Well, Miss Woodhouse, your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors of my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a thought of my father’s, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?	1	304	60	began	almost immediately	f	f	f	f
2852	The Crown!	2	304	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2853	Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope you consent?	3	304	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2854	It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?	4	304	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3405	Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.	6	355	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2855	No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh! no—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.	5	304	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2856	I was going to observe, sir, that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.	6	304	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2857	Sir, you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.	7	304	47	said	rather warmly	f	f	f	f
2858	From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.	8	304	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2859	Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it.	9	304	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2860	Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have often known it done myself.	10	304	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2861	Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done.	11	304	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2862	But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—	12	304	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2863	Oh!, there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be so near their own stable.	13	304	48	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
2864	So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.	14	304	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2865	I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.	15	304	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2866	There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? ‘If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!	16	304	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2867	Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella’s little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry.	17	304	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2868	My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment, examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without you.	18	304	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2869	Emma, this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.	1	305	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2870	My dear, you are too particular. What does all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our club-nights.	2	305	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2871	I do not think it is so very small. We shall not be many, you know.	3	305	51	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
2872	You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.	4	305	56	calling out	\N	f	f	f	f
2873	I wish one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.	5	305	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3014	If we were in the other room, if I had my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.—Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?	35	319	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3020	But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked forward to the summer in general.	2	320	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2874	Yes, very true, very true. You want your neighbours’ opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief of them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?	6	305	60	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
2875	Well—if you please, if you think she will be of any use.	7	305	51	said	rather hesitating	f	f	f	f
2876	You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates. She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates.	8	305	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2877	But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.	9	305	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2878	Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.	10	305	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2879	Both sir! Can the old lady?	11	305	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2880	The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.	12	305	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2881	Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect. Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.	13	305	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2882	Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins’s week’s account; much rather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not I, indeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different.	1	306	49	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
2883	Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with very great pleasure.	2	306	58	said	voluntarily	f	f	f	f
2884	that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.	1	307	51	added	\N	f	f	f	f
2885	I said it would be so.	2	307	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2886	Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.	1	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2887	But you will come again. This will not be your only visit to Randalls.	2	308	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2888	Ah!—the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but I am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.	3	308	60	shaking his head	\N	f	f	f	f
2889	Our poor ball must be quite given up.	4	308	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2890	Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?	5	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2891	Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise.	6	308	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2892	If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement.	7	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2893	Such a fortnight as it has been!; every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!	7	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2894	As you do us such ample justice now, I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.	9	308	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2895	And you must be off this very morning?	10	308	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2896	Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him.	11	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2897	Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours.	12	308	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2898	Yes—I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then	13	308	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2899	In short, perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion	14	308	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2900	You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then	15	308	48	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
2901	It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm	16	308	60	said	in a more determined manner	f	f	f	f
2902	It was time to go.	17	308	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2903	I shall hear about you all; that is my chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.	18	308	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2904	You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!	1	309	49	added	with considerable kindness	f	f	f	f
2905	it was very true—it was just as Miss Woodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she would not think about them any longer	1	310	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3016	Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley.	37	319	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3022	I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.	4	320	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3023	Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.	5	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2906	Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me. You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure you.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it.	2	310	48	attacked	\N	f	f	f	f
2907	I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very important—and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due—or rather what would be kind by me.	3	310	48	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2908	You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for you!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!	4	310	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2909	Well, Miss Woodhouse; Well, Miss Woodhouse, what do you think of her?—Is not she very charming?	1	311	50	said	with a gentle sigh	f	f	f	f
2910	Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.	2	311	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2911	I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.	3	311	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2912	Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.	4	311	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2913	I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.	5	311	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2914	Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and she came in his way.	6	311	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2915	I dare say, I dare say she was very much attached to him.	7	311	50	returned	sighing again	f	f	f	f
2916	Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.	8	311	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2917	Yes, and well she might, nobody could ever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as superior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’ How delightful!	9	311	50	said	earnestly	f	f	f	f
2918	My brother Mr. Suckling’s seat	1	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2919	Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister’s favourite room. Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.	2	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2920	And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.	3	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2921	So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like. The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.	4	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2922	When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.	5	312	48	said	in reply	f	f	f	f
2923	Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England.	6	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2924	Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.	7	312	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2925	No, I fancy not. I never heard any county but Surry called so.	8	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2926	My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest; and that will be our time for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?	9	312	64	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
2927	No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.	10	312	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2944	Knightley! Knightley himself!—Was not it lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.’s, I had a great curiosity. ‘My friend Knightley’ had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.	27	312	64	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3017	Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill, writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of course, put forth his best.	38	319	49	said	dryly	f	f	f	f
3434	Thank you.	23	356	49	said	in an accent of deep mortification	f	f	f	f
2928	Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.’ Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse—Your father’s state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.	11	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2929	My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.	12	312	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2930	Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public with.	13	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2931	but their going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.	14	312	48	thanked	coolly	f	f	f	f
2932	I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions, a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer.	15	312	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2933	Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior performer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of music—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had been accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension. When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was not necessary to me. I could do very well without it. To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. ‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.’	16	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2934	We cannot suppose that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.	17	312	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2935	No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. Will not it be a good plan? If we exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.	18	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2936	But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger, surely?	19	312	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2937	I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never touches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.	20	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2938	But every thing of that kind will soon be in so regular a train—	21	312	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2939	Well, we shall see.	22	312	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2940	We have been calling at Randalls, and found them both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. And she appears so truly good—there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, I think?	23	312	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2941	Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.	24	312	64	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
2942	Mrs. Weston’s manners were always particularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman.	25	312	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2943	And who do you think came in while we were there?	26	312	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2986	Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become indifferent. Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very positive curse.	7	319	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3018	Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.	39	319	64	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3435	You are going in, I suppose?	24	356	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2945	Well, my dear, considering we never saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think he had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course of the summer. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.	1	313	47	began	deliberately	f	f	f	f
2946	I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.	2	313	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2947	Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible. It was being very deficient.	3	313	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2948	But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? It ought to be no recommendation to you. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them.	4	313	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2949	No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to her. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may.	5	313	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2950	Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.	6	313	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2951	My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.	7	313	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2952	Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet, ‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,     ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’  We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.	1	314	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2953	I cannot think there is any danger of it—and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax’s situation and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.	2	314	48	answer	calm	f	f	f	f
2954	Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it. I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express.	3	314	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2955	You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than	4	314	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2956	My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. We have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.	5	314	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2957	We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.	1	315	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2958	You are right, Mrs. Weston, Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.	2	315	49	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
2959	Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.	3	315	48	replied	presently	f	f	f	f
2960	I should not wonder if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.	4	315	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2987	You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship.	8	319	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3019	Here is April come!, I get quite anxious about you. June will soon be here.	1	320	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2961	Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her. We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness.	5	315	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2962	I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax.	6	315	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2963	Yes, any body may know how highly I think of her.	7	315	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2964	And yet—And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other.	8	315	48	said	beginning hastily and with an arch look	f	f	f	f
2965	Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.	9	315	49	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
2966	That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall never ask her.	10	315	49	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
2967	You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.	11	315	48	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
2968	So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?	12	315	49	said	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
2969	No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.	13	315	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2970	No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you. Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.	14	315	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2971	Well, and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?	15	315	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2972	Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours.	16	315	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2973	In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.	17	315	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2974	Jane Fairfax has feeling—I do not accuse her of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no thought beyond.	18	315	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2975	Well, Mrs. Weston, what do you say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?	19	315	48	said	triumphantly	f	f	f	f
2976	Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.	20	315	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2977	I see how it is. I see what a life I am to lead among you. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.	1	316	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2978	She would rather not be in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.	1	317	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2979	This is very true, at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the same age—and always knowing her—I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater attention than I have done.	1	318	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2980	I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned directly.	1	319	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2981	I went only to the post-office, and reached home before the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk before breakfast does me good.	2	319	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2982	Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.	3	319	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2983	No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.	4	319	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2984	That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for.	5	319	55	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
2985	I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters.	6	319	58	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
3447	Not at all. I should wish it.	6	357	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2989	Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than to-day.	10	319	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2990	When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years, I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.	11	319	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2991	I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?	12	319	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2992	Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me.	13	319	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2993	My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.	14	319	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2994	My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.	15	319	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2995	Oh! do not tell me. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our authority.	16	319	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
2996	My advice, I certainly do feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.—Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.	17	319	51	said	kindly and persuasively	f	f	f	f
2997	Oh! she shall not do such a thing again. We will not allow her to do such a thing again: there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.	18	319	64	rejoined	eagerly	f	f	f	f
2998	You are extremely kind; but I cannot give up my early walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.	19	319	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
2999	My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.	20	319	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3000	Excuse me, I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama’s.	21	319	58	said	earnestly	f	f	f	f
3001	Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to employ our men.	22	319	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3002	The post-office is a wonderful establishment!—The regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!	23	319	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3004	So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose, actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.	25	319	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3003	It is certainly very well regulated.	24	319	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3005	The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther explanation, they are paid for it. That is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served well.	26	319	55	continued	smiling	f	f	f	f
3006	I have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not always known their writing apart.	27	319	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3007	Yes, there is a likeness. I know what you mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.	28	319	49	said	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
3008	Isabella and Emma both write beautifully; and always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston.	29	319	47	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3009	I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting	29	319	48	began	\N	f	f	f	f
3010	Now, how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.—No, I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and better.—Now for it.	31	319	48	reflect	\N	f	f	f	f
3011	Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.	32	319	48	began	again	f	f	f	f
3012	I do not admire it. It is too small—wants strength. It is like a woman’s writing.	33	319	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3013	No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?	34	319	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3015	He chose to say he was employed—	36	319	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3021	But have you really heard of nothing?	3	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3024	I not aware!; dear Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?	6	320	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3025	But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish to see you in.	7	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3026	Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer. I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.	8	320	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3027	Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.	9	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3028	Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.	10	320	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3029	But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.	11	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3030	Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something—Offices for the sale—not quite of human flesh—but of human intellect.	12	320	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3031	Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.	13	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3032	I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade; governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do.	14	320	58	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3034	You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. A gentleman’s family is all that I should condition for.	16	320	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3035	I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.	17	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3033	Something that would do! Aye, that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life.	15	320	64	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3036	You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together, they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as I am.	18	320	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3037	And I am quite serious too, I assure you, in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.	19	320	64	replied	gaily	f	f	f	f
3038	Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he is;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like it?—Selina’s choice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will look well?	20	320	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3039	I could not have believed it even of him.	1	321	55	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3040	Read it, read it, it will give you pleasure; only a few lines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.	1	322	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3079	Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg you to send them home.	11	324	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3113	I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!	7	330	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3115	Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!	9	330	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3120	Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.	14	330	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3452	You had better go on.	13	357	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3041	Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In town next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way.	2	322	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3042	I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you.	1	323	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3043	You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume—and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.	2	323	56	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3044	Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.	3	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3045	You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.— He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter.	4	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3046	And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr. Weston—I must protest against that.—A most dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!	5	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3047	Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs. Elton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry, merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to move southward without loss of time.	6	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3048	Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?	7	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3049	Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a considerable journey.	8	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3050	Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses.	9	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3051	The evil of the distance from Enscombe is, that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that.	10	323	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3052	No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?	11	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3053	Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for	12	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3054	Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea.	13	323	64	interposed	eagerly	f	f	f	f
3055	Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.	14	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3056	Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill’s illness.	15	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3057	If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or to Clifton?	16	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3058	She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired.	17	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3059	Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You seem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot have too many resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society.	18	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3060	Frank was here in February for a fortnight.	19	323	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3061	So I remember to have heard. He will find an addition to the society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world.	20	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3062	My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.	21	323	56	exclaimed	immediately	f	f	f	f
3112	Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.	6	330	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3114	And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.	8	330	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3063	When Frank left us, it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn up—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.	22	323	56	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3064	Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May before Hymen’s saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair.	23	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3065	You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.	24	323	56	going on	\N	f	f	f	f
3066	And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer.	25	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3067	I hope I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank’s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.	26	323	56	said	presently	f	f	f	f
3068	Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him—I believe, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death.	27	323	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3069	Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.	1	324	55	began with	\N	f	f	f	f
3070	I rather hope to satisfy you both, for I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.	2	324	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3071	And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.	3	324	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3072	That is very likely. You think so, do not you?	4	324	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3073	I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately.	5	324	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3074	Increase!	6	324	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3075	Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life.	7	324	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3076	Difference! No indeed I am not.	8	324	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3077	There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.	9	324	55	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3078	Yes, it is Randalls that does it all.	10	324	49	said	quickly	f	f	f	f
3080	No, that need not be the consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.	12	324	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3081	Upon my word, you amuse me! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what have they been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of, which never took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one—and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his accounts.	13	324	48	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
3082	He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.	1	325	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3083	I think she must be here soon. I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.	1	326	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3084	I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.	2	326	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3085	But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax! We thought you were to bring them.	3	326	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3086	I will see that there are umbrellas, sir: Miss Bates must not be forgotten.	4	326	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3087	A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and approve—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better.	5	326	64	begin	so briskly	f	f	f	f
3088	I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a pleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of them.	6	326	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3089	So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane, look!—did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin’s lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs. Stokes,’ said I—but I had not time for more. Very well, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in one day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my word, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not warm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s wedding-present.—So kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to step upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?—Ah! here’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?—Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a judge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the town—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do you do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never better.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the worthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!	7	326	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3090	How do you like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my hair?	8	326	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3091	Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well.	9	326	64	said	then	f	f	f	f
3092	Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us.	10	326	64	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
3093	Jane! That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.	11	326	60	repeated	with a look of surprize and displeasure	f	f	f	f
3094	How do you like Mrs. Elton?	12	326	48	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
3095	Not at all.	13	326	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3096	You are ungrateful.	14	326	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3097	Ungrateful!—What do you mean? No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing?	15	326	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3098	And what are we to do for a proper partner for her? She will think Frank ought to ask her.	16	326	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3099	Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?	1	327	51	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3100	Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.	2	327	52	reply	prompt	f	f	f	f
3101	Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer.	3	327	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3102	If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance, I shall have great pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.	4	327	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3103	Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.	5	327	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3104	Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your command—but my dancing days are over.	6	327	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3105	Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good-natured, I declare.	1	328	64	observing	audibly	f	f	f	f
3106	Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One door nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’ My dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such elegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.	1	329	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3107	They aimed at wounding more than Harriet. Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?	1	330	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3108	She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.	2	330	49	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3109	I did, and they cannot forgive me.	3	330	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3110	I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.	4	330	49	said	only	f	f	f	f
3111	Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?	5	330	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3116	I am ready whenever I am wanted.	10	330	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3392	You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now—it is possible—	20	354	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3398	Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.	26	354	48	say	on reply	f	f	f	f
3122	Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I should like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it will be over.	1	331	50	began	thus	f	f	f	f
3123	It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish, to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is necessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.	2	331	50	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3124	Yes, I hope I do.	3	331	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3125	How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...	4	331	50	cried	warmly	f	f	f	f
3126	It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the two I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall never forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me another moment’s pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to have destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it all—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?	5	331	50	said	with a conscious look	f	f	f	f
3127	Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?	6	331	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3128	No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much.	7	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3129	Now, you must recollect.	8	331	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3130	No, indeed I do not.	9	331	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3131	Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it—so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great treat.	10	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3132	My dearest Harriet!, you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear. Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on—what else?	11	331	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3133	And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally.	12	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3134	And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!	13	331	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3135	Here, here is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did.	14	331	50	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
3136	This was really his—Do not you remember one morning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget exactly the day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.	15	331	50	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3137	I do remember it; I perfectly remember it.—Talking about spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly remember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.	16	331	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3138	Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now.	17	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3139	Well, go on.	18	331	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3140	Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it.	19	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3141	My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?	20	331	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3142	Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but had not resolution enough to part with them.	21	331	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3143	But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.	22	331	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3144	I shall be happier to burn it. It has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.	23	331	50	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3145	Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so	1	332	48	said	merely	f	f	f	f
3146	I shall never marry.	2	332	50	say	in a very serious tone	f	f	f	f
3147	Never marry!—This is a new resolution.	3	332	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3148	It is one that I shall never change, however.	4	332	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3149	I hope it does not proceed from—I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?	5	332	48	\N	after another short hesitation	f	f	f	f
3150	Mr. Elton indeed! Oh! no, so superior to Mr. Elton!	6	332	50	cried	indignantly	f	f	f	f
3151	Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?	7	332	48	spoke	thus	f	f	f	f
3265	With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm.	32	344	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3176	My dear Emma, do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?	4	335	49	said	at last	f	f	f	f
3152	Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose— Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially.	8	332	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3153	I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.	9	332	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3154	Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him coming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!	10	332	50	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3155	It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value.	11	332	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3156	By the bye, what became of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?	1	333	60	said	presently	f	f	f	f
3157	I did not know that he ever had any such plan.	2	333	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3158	Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.	3	333	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3159	Me! impossible!	4	333	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3160	Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?	5	333	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3161	Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.	6	333	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3162	Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.	7	333	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3163	What is this?—What is this?, about Perry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?	8	333	56	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3164	No, sir, I seem to have had it from nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.	9	333	60	replied	laughing	f	f	f	f
3165	It is odd though, that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his carriage! and his wife’s persuading him to it, out of care for his health—just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?	10	333	56	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
3166	Why, to own the truth, if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean to say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t you remember grandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I do not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary dream, indeed!	11	333	57	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3167	Miss Woodhouse, have your nephews taken away their alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again.	1	334	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3168	Nonsense! for shame!	2	334	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3169	I will give it to her—shall I?	3	334	60	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3170	No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.	4	334	48	opposing	with eager laughing warmth	f	f	f	f
3171	I did not know that proper names were allowed.	5	334	58	saying	only	f	f	f	f
3172	Aye, very true, my dear—I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night.	6	334	57	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3173	Pray, Emma, may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.	1	335	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3174	Oh!, it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.	2	335	48	cried	in evident embarrassment	f	f	f	f
3175	The joke seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill.	3	335	49	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
3177	Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.—Why do you make a doubt of it?	5	335	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3178	Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?	6	335	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3179	Never, never!—Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could it possibly come into your head?	7	335	48	cried	with a most open eagerness	f	f	f	f
3180	I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.	8	335	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3181	Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings rather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s indifference.	9	335	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3182	I am glad you approve of what I have done. But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her out.	1	336	52	said	very comfortably	f	f	f	f
3183	Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?—And such weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.	1	337	64	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3184	You had better explore to Donwell. That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening fast.	2	337	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3185	You may depend upon me. I certainly will come. Name your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?	4	337	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3186	I cannot name a day till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you.” “Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.	5	337	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3187	Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.	6	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3188	I hope you will bring Elton: but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations.	7	337	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3189	Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be afraid of delegating power to me. I am no young lady on her preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests.	8	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3190	No—there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and that one is—	9	337	49	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
3191	—Mrs. Weston, I suppose.	10	337	64	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
3192	No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such matters myself.	11	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3193	Ah! you are an odd creature!—You are a humourist, and may say what you like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.	12	337	64	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3194	You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home.	13	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3195	That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be no form or parade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors—a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?	14	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3196	Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.	15	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3197	Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything—	16	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3198	I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.	17	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3199	Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever.	18	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3200	I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would spurn any body’s assistance.	19	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3201	I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt.	20	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3202	You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.	21	337	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3288	So very kind! But you are always kind.	6	347	57	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3338	Well, my dear, I have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.	22	353	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3341	Have you indeed no idea? Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?	25	353	51	said	in a trembling voice	f	f	f	f
3399	Oh God! that I had never seen her!	27	354	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3445	Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his way. One man’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be severe.	4	357	49	observed	with a smile	f	f	f	f
3203	That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend. Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please me.	22	337	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3204	Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them—very kind and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining out.	23	337	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3205	The best fruit in England—every body’s favourite—always wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather for one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely superior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very scarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of strawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple Grove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly different—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their way—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to cherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no longer—must go and sit in the shade.	1	338	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3206	Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens—all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.	1	339	58	proposed	\N	f	f	f	f
3207	His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.	1	340	60	expressed	with more than common certainty	f	f	f	f
3208	Will you be so kind, when I am missed, as to say that I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?	1	341	58	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3209	Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?	2	341	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3210	Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes.	3	341	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3211	But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my father’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be round in five minutes.	4	341	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3212	Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for me to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have to guard others!	5	341	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3213	That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.	6	341	48	replied	feelingly	f	f	f	f
3214	I am—I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.	7	341	58	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3215	Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!	8	341	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3216	You will soon be cooler, if you sit still.	1	342	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3217	As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met one as I came—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!	2	342	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3218	No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him hotter.	3	342	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3219	As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad. I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself.	1	343	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3220	That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.	2	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3221	They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy—I am sick of England—and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.	3	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3222	You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?	4	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3223	I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person.	5	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3224	You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.	6	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3225	No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.	7	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3226	We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change. You will stay, and go with us?	8	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3227	No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.	9	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3228	But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.	10	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3229	No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.	11	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3230	Then pray stay at Richmond.	12	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3231	But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me.	13	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3232	These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.	14	343	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3233	Well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will.	15	343	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3289	Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?	7	347	48	inquiry	direct	f	f	f	f
3234	How much I am obliged to you, for telling me to come to-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.	1	344	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3235	Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.	2	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3236	Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.	3	344	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3237	It is hotter to-day.	4	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3238	Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.	5	344	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3239	You are comfortable because you are under command.	6	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3240	Your command?—Yes.	7	344	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3241	Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine.	8	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3242	It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are always with me.	9	344	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3243	Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.	10	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3244	Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you first in February.	11	344	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3245	Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But—nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.	12	344	48	lowering her voice	\N	f	f	f	f
3246	I say nothing of which I am ashamed. I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.	13	344	60	replied	with lively impudence	f	f	f	f
3247	Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?	14	344	60	whispering	then	f	f	f	f
3248	Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?	15	344	49	answer	most distinct	f	f	f	f
3249	Oh! no, no—Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.	16	344	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3250	It is a sort of thing, which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party—I never was in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—	17	344	64	cried	emphatically	f	f	f	f
3251	Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body knows what is due to you.	18	344	52	murmured	in reply	f	f	f	f
3252	It will not do; they are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two things moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all.	19	344	60	whispered	to Emma	f	f	f	f
3253	Oh! very well, then I need not be uneasy. ‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?	20	344	57	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
3254	Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be limited as to number—only three at once.	21	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3255	Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.	22	344	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3256	I like your plan. Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?	23	344	56	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3257	Low, I am afraid, sir, very low; but we shall be indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.	24	344	60	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3258	No, no, it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr. Weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me hear it.	25	344	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3259	I doubt its being very clever myself. It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?	26	344	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3260	What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.	27	344	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3261	Ah! you will never guess. You, I am certain, will never guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you understand?	28	344	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3262	This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else. Perfection should not have come quite so soon.	29	344	49	said	gravely	f	f	f	f
3263	Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused; I really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know who I mean. These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty things at every body’s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever to say—not one of us.	30	344	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3264	Yes, yes, pray pass me; I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?	31	344	52	added	with a sort of sneering consciousness	f	f	f	f
3336	Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.	20	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3266	Happy couple! How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!—for as to any real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!	1	345	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3267	Such things do occur, undoubtedly.	2	345	58	spoke	now	f	f	f	f
3268	You were speaking.	3	345	60	said	gravely	f	f	f	f
3269	I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.	4	345	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3270	Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know. Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate her.	5	345	60	said	soon afterwards, in a lively tone	f	f	f	f
3271	And make her like myself.	6	345	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3272	By all means, if you can.	7	345	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3273	Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.	8	345	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3274	She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember.	9	345	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3275	Now, ma’am, shall we join Mrs. Elton?	10	345	58	said	to her aunt	f	f	f	f
3276	If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall soon overtake her. There she is—no, that’s somebody else. That’s one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.—Well, I declare—	11	345	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3277	Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not thought it possible.	1	346	49	said	then	f	f	f	f
3278	Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.	2	346	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3279	I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome.	3	346	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3280	Oh!, I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her.	4	346	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3400	such things always got about.	1	355	56	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
3282	They are blended, I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now	5	346	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3283	Well, my dear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.	1	347	57	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3284	I am afraid Jane is not very well, but I do not know; they tell me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like? I am sure she will be here presently.	2	347	65	said	\N	t	f	f	f
3285	Very happy and obliged	3	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3286	Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie down upon the bed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I was quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’ said I, ‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’ ‘Well,’ said she, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.’ But then Patty came in, and said it was you. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’ said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must go, my dear,’ said I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.’	4	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3287	It must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.	5	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3406	I am afraid that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy.	7	355	48	returned	sighing	f	f	f	f
3290	To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge of her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.	8	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3291	Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—	9	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3413	You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you.	2	356	48	began	\N	f	f	f	f
3292	Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell’s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane’s answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge’s situation, she had come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word of it till it was all settled.	10	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3293	You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?	11	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3294	Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You must all spend your evening with us,’ said she—‘I positively must have you all come.’	12	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3295	Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?	13	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3296	No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.	14	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3297	Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?	15	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3298	I dare say she had.	16	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3299	Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.	17	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3300	Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.—And her salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.	18	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3301	Ah! madam, if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned.	19	347	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3302	You are so noble in your ideas!	20	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3303	And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?	21	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3304	Very soon, very soon, indeed; that’s the worst of it. Within a fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come ma’am, do not let us think about it any more.	22	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3305	Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return?	23	347	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3337	Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.	21	353	56	added	in a tone much more guarded and demure	f	f	f	f
3339	I have been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.	23	353	56	add	in a lower tone	f	f	f	f
3340	What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.	24	353	48	said	eagerly	f	f	f	f
3342	So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.	26	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3343	You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly; He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—	27	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3344	More than an attachment, indeed; an engagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!	28	353	51	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
3345	Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?	29	353	48	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
3346	You may well be amazed—You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew him.	30	353	51	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
3365	None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves.	49	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3421	The feelings of the warmest friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!	10	356	49	added	in a more broken and subdued accent	f	f	f	f
3306	Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.	24	347	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3307	Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become of that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.—‘You must go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You will have no business here.—Let it stay, however,’ said she; ‘give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.’—And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter’s.	25	347	57	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3308	I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?	1	348	49	said	in a manner decidedly graver than usual	f	f	f	f
3309	Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?	2	348	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3310	Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.	3	348	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3311	Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so attentive to them!	4	348	47	began his inquiries	\N	f	f	f	f
3312	I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me. You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.	5	348	47	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3313	Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the temper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.	1	349	62	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3314	Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!	2	349	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3315	Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write.	1	350	66	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3316	Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and Mrs. Cole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so much—but, except them, Jane would really see nobody.	1	351	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3317	dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she could not take—and, moreover, she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.	1	352	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3318	could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.	1	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3319	Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.	2	353	56	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3320	Is she unwell?	3	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3321	No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone, and that you know—Humph!—Can you come?	4	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3322	Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not ill?	5	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3323	Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!	6	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3324	Now—now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.	8	353	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3325	No, no—Don’t ask me. I promised my wife to leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.	9	353	56	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
3326	Break it to me. Good God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in Brunswick Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it is.	10	353	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3327	No, indeed you are mistaken.	11	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3328	Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.	12	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3329	Upon my word, Emma.	13	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3330	Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?	14	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3331	Upon my honour, it does not. It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley.	15	353	56	said	very seriously	f	f	f	f
3332	I was wrong in talking of its being broke to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you—it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don’t say that it is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.	16	353	56	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3333	Who is that gentleman on horseback?	17	353	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3334	I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.	18	353	56	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3335	Has your son been with you, then?	19	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3347	Well; this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of them came to Highbury?	31	353	48	said	at last	f	f	f	f
3348	Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. Some part of his conduct we cannot excuse.	32	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3349	I will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of.	33	353	48	replied	then	f	f	f	f
3350	That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference, I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay, was attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder. Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past, for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.	34	353	48	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3351	Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself. On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.— Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.	35	353	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3352	I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit him, Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so very disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong indeed.	36	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3353	From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—	37	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3354	And how could she bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman, before her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect.	38	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3355	There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.	39	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3356	Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his life.	40	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3357	Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having many, very many, good qualities; and—	41	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3358	Good God!—Mrs. Smallridge, too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her even to think of such a measure!	42	353	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3359	He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long.	43	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3360	I am to hear from him soon. He told me at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood. Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to condemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment.	44	353	51	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3361	His sufferings do not appear to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?	45	353	48	replied	dryly	f	f	f	f
3362	Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with very little persuasion.	46	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3363	This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some time—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.	47	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3364	And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?	48	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3401	On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so many months, she was energetic. This was one of her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.	2	355	51	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3414	Have I?; of what nature?	3	356	49	said	quietly	f	f	f	f
3422	He will soon be gone. They will soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her. She deserves a better fate.	11	356	49	concluded with	in a louder, steadier tone	f	f	f	f
3366	Well, I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.—They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!	50	353	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3367	I am quite easy on that head. I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have heard.	51	353	51	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3368	You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.	52	353	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3369	True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.	53	353	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3370	Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be said in her situation for even that error!	54	353	51	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3371	Much, indeed! If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s, nor the world’s law.’	55	353	48	cried	feelingly	f	f	f	f
3372	A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.	56	353	48	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
3384	I should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should not have dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if you, who had been always acquainted with him—	12	354	50	began	\N	f	f	f	f
3393	I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may appear—. But you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should really—if he does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.	21	354	50	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
3402	Poor girl! She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?	3	355	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3407	On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was that of making her unreasonable. The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for him to bear. ‘I did not make the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.’ She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.	8	355	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3408	If I did not know her to be happy now, which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is very good—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.	9	355	48	said	seriously	f	f	f	f
3415	Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.	4	356	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3419	You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—I seem to have been doomed to blindness.	8	356	48	say	presently, with a little more composure	f	f	f	f
3420	Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent sense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow yourself—.	9	356	49	saying	in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low	f	f	f	f
3428	I have no doubt of their being happy together; I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.	17	356	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3431	And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.	20	356	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3423	You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you right.— I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.	12	356	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3424	Emma!, are you, indeed? No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret, indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that there was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?—Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.	13	356	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3425	Mr. Knightley—I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I never have.	14	356	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3426	I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story, probably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him very pleasant—and, in short, for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some time, indeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself—except that I was not blinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him.	15	356	48	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
3427	I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose, however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him well.	16	356	49	said	tolerably in his usual tone	f	f	f	f
3429	He is a most fortunate man! So early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man indeed!	18	356	49	returned	with energy	f	f	f	f
3432	You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but I cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.	21	356	49	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3433	Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it. Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.	22	356	48	cried	eagerly	f	f	f	f
3436	No—I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not gone.	25	356	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3437	I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I will tell you exactly what I think.	26	356	48	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3438	As a friend!—Emma, that I fear is a word—No, I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?	27	356	49	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3439	My dearest Emma, for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.	28	356	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3440	You are silent!; absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.	29	356	49	cried	with great animation	f	f	f	f
3441	I cannot make speeches, Emma:—If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you understand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.	30	356	49	resumed	soon	f	f	f	f
3442	I shall be very glad to look it over; but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night.	1	357	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3443	I would rather be talking to you; but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done.	2	357	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3444	Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.	3	357	49	say	almost directly	f	f	f	f
3446	It will be natural for me to speak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—	5	357	49	added	shortly afterwards	f	f	f	f
3448	He trifles here as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to have formed the engagement.—‘His father’s disposition:’—he is unjust, however, to his father. Mr. Weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.	7	357	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3449	And I have not forgotten how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you were perfectly right.	8	357	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3450	I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had you not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.	9	357	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3451	Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No judge of his own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?	11	357	49	concluding	seriously, and, after steady reflection	f	f	f	f
3453	the pianoforte! Ah! That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument’s coming if she could.	14	357	49	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3454	I perfectly agree with you, sir. You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.	16	357	49	remark	\N	f	f	f	f
3455	This is very bad.—He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.	17	357	49	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3456	There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons—His feelings are natural.—What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well, he must be a most extraordinary—	19	357	49	observation	next	f	f	f	f
3457	Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.	20	357	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3458	I hope he does. ‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all this?	21	357	49	replied	coolly	f	f	f	f
3459	She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s children—a dear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?	22	357	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3460	Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the man writes!	23	357	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3461	I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.	24	357	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3462	Well, there is feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I deserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s words, were they?— And a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune! That was your name for him, was it?	25	357	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3484	Your parish there was small.	25	359	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3463	You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I hope it does him some service with you.	26	357	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3464	Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something else. I have another person’s interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject.	27	357	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3465	While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him.	28	357	48	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
3466	Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for. I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you ask mine.	30	357	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3467	This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without words.	2	358	58	said	in a low, but very feeling tone	f	f	f	f
3468	We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word more. Let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember those lines—I forget the poem at this moment: “For when a lady’s in the case, “You know all other things give place.”  Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read——mum! a word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation, you see, has quite appeased her.	1	359	64	saying	with significant nods	f	f	f	f
3469	I mentioned no names, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well.	7	359	64	added	in a half whisper	f	f	f	f
3923	Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her instrument is open.	5	402	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3924	She is walking, I believe.	6	402	78	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3470	Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?—Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!	9	359	64	addressed	abruptly with	f	f	f	f
3471	We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.	10	359	64	whispered	farther	f	f	f	f
3472	I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party, not one exception.	11	359	64	began	shortly afterwards	f	f	f	f
3473	Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—that is, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!	13	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3474	Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.	14	359	64	said	speaking louder	f	f	f	f
3475	What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.	15	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3476	Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to night.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence or other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without him.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half so many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.	17	359	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3477	A congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.	17	359	64	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3478	He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.	19	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3479	Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.	20	359	48	said	only	f	f	f	f
3480	Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.	21	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3481	Have not you mistaken the day? I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.	22	359	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3482	Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day.	23	359	57	answer	abrupt	f	f	f	f
3483	I do believe this is the most troublesome parish that ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.	24	359	57	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3485	Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of.	26	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3486	But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.	27	359	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3487	Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that some people may not think you perfection already.—But hush!—not a word, if you please.	28	359	57	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3499	Very.	6	360	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3523	Emma, my dear Emma—	7	362	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3531	I do not know which it ought to be called.	3	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3488	Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?	31	359	64	greeted	with some of her sparkling vivacity	f	f	f	f
3489	When I got to Donwell, Knightley could not be found. Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.	33	359	52	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3490	Donwell!—My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.	34	359	64	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3491	No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went over the fields too—which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?	35	359	52	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3492	I cannot imagine, I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.	37	359	64	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3577	If not in our dispositions, there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.	24	366	48	added	presently, with a look of true sensibility	f	f	f	f
4655	no, no—not at all—no, thank you	2	481	92	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
3493	I met William Larkins as I got near the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.	38	359	52	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3494	It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent.	1	360	48	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3495	Oh!—there would have been no danger. The danger would have been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your compassion does not stand my friend—	2	360	58	cried	with a blush and an hesitation	f	f	f	f
3496	Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are. You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted even—	3	360	48	cried	warmly	f	f	f	f
3497	You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you.	4	360	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3498	Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?	5	360	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3500	And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—just as I begin to know you.	7	360	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3501	Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.	8	360	58	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3502	Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps—but, excuse me, it must be thought of.	9	360	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3503	You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.	11	360	58	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3504	Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—Good-bye, good-bye.	12	360	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3505	She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me—like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.	1	361	48	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3506	That is, she will indulge her even more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will be the only difference.	2	361	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3507	Poor child!; at that rate, what will become of her?	3	361	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3508	Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?	4	361	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3509	But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.	5	361	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3516	And cannot you call me ‘George’ now?	12	361	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3530	Good or bad?	2	364	48	said	quickly	f	f	f	f
3543	I mean that he has done it, and been accepted.	18	364	49	answered	with smiling but determined decision	f	f	f	f
3545	Well, now tell me every thing; make this intelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how has it been possible?	20	364	48	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3556	I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.	34	364	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3558	Me! Ah! poor Harriet!	36	364	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3565	I never had the smallest, I assure you.	8	366	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3510	Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.	6	361	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3511	I am sure you were of use to me. I was very often influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen.	7	361	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3512	How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, I did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one.	8	361	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3513	What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.	9	361	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3514	‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr. Knightley;’ and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.	10	361	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3515	I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.	11	361	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3666	Aye, aye, I see how it will be, I see how it will be. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor Brandon.	17	377	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3517	Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr. Knightley.’ I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise—I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.	13	361	48	added	presently	f	f	f	f
3518	John does not even mention your friend. Here is his answer, if you like to see it.	1	362	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3519	John enters like a brother into my happiness, but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.	3	362	49	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3520	He writes like a sensible man. I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.	4	362	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3521	My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—	5	362	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3522	He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two—much less, perhaps, than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject.	6	362	48	interrupted	with a sort of serious smile	f	f	f	f
3524	Oh!, if you fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing you justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into ‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.	8	362	48	cried	with more thorough gaiety	f	f	f	f
3525	Ah!, I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you notice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind.	9	362	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3526	If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly unprepared for that.	10	362	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3527	Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems always tired now.’	11	362	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3528	It is to be a secret, I conclude. These matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.	1	363	56	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3529	I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.	1	364	49	began with	in a graver tone	f	f	f	f
3532	Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile.	4	364	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3533	I am afraid, I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.	5	364	49	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3534	Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.	6	364	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3535	There is one subject, I hope but one, on which we do not think alike.	7	364	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3536	Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet Smith.	8	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3537	Have you heard from her yourself this morning? You have, I believe, and know the whole.	10	364	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3538	No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.	11	364	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3539	You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.	12	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3540	It is so, indeed; I have it from Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.	14	364	49	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3541	You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject.	16	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3542	You mistake me, you quite mistake me. It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.	17	364	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3544	Good God! Well!	19	364	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3546	It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which he did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving. He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications we deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s heart seemed for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.	21	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3576	Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.	22	366	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3547	Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight you.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.	23	364	49	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3548	You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. Her connexions may be worse than his. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him, much more, than she was before.	25	364	48	answering	cheerfully	f	f	f	f
3549	You ought to know your friend best; but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.	26	364	49	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3550	Upon my word, I believe you know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him. I could suppose she might in time—but can she already?—Did not you misunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.	27	364	48	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3551	Do you dare say this? Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do you deserve?	29	364	49	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3552	Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?	30	364	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3553	I am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.	31	364	49	replied	speaking very distinctly	f	f	f	f
3554	I am perfectly satisfied, and most sincerely wish them happy.	32	364	48	replied	with the brightest smiles	f	f	f	f
3555	You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.	33	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3557	And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.	35	364	49	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3559	It is Frank and Miss Fairfax. I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.—They are coming in, I hope.	1	365	51	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3560	I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.	1	366	60	say	\N	f	f	f	f
3561	No, indeed, not in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy in person.	2	366	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3562	Is not she looking well? Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her.	4	366	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3563	I can never think of it without extreme shame.	6	366	48	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3564	The shame is all mine, or ought to be. But is it possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you had none.	7	366	60	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3566	That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.	9	366	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3567	It is not now worth a regret.	10	366	48	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3568	I have some hope of my uncle’s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a distance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?	11	366	60	resumed	\N	f	f	f	f
3569	Ah! by the bye—I hope Mr. Knightley is well?	13	366	60	cried	with a sudden accession of gay thought	f	f	f	f
3570	I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.	14	366	48	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3571	Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet without being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair—a most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour enough for beauty.	16	366	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3572	I have always admired her complexion; but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite forgotten?	17	366	48	replied	archly	f	f	f	f
3573	Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—	18	366	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3574	I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am sure it was a consolation to you.	20	366	48	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3575	Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most miserable wretch!	21	366	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4049	Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?	49	408	82	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3578	True, true. No, not true on your side. You can have no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete angel. Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will be glad to hear that my uncle means to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?	25	366	60	answered	warmly	f	f	f	f
3579	Very beautiful, indeed.	26	366	48	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3580	How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent looks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.	27	366	60	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3581	She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it.	1	367	51	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3582	Perry! My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel now?—Has he set up his carriage?	3	367	60	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3583	Such an extraordinary dream of mine! I can never think of it without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole blunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?	5	367	60	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3584	How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They will sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!	7	367	58	said	in a conscious, low, yet steady voice	f	f	f	f
3585	It was my father’s last request to me that I should assist his widow and daughters.	1	368	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3586	He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child.	2	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3587	He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.	3	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3588	Well, then, let something be done for them; but that something need not be three thousand pounds. Consider that when the money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy—	4	368	68	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3589	Why, to be sure, that would make great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would be a very convenient addition.	5	368	67	said	very gravely	f	f	f	f
3590	To be sure it would.	6	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3591	Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!	7	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3592	Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters, even if really his sisters! And as it is—only half blood!—But you have such a generous spirit!	8	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3593	I would not wish to do any thing mean. One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly expect more.	9	368	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3594	There is no knowing what they may expect, but we are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.	10	368	68	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3595	Certainly—and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother’s death—a very comfortable fortune for any young woman.	11	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3596	To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds.	12	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3597	That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself. A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.	13	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3598	To be sure, it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.	15	368	68	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3599	Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase.	16	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3600	Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father’s will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother’s disposal, without any restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.	17	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3601	It is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one’s income. One’s fortune, as your mother justly says, is not one’s own. To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one’s independence.	18	368	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4050	We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.	50	408	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3602	Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.	19	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3603	I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.	20	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3604	To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season. I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give you something.	21	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3605	Upon my word, I believe you are perfectly right. My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described. When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then.	22	368	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3606	Certainly. But, however, one thing must be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.	23	368	68	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
3607	That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.	24	368	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3608	Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place they can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is. Your father thought only of them. And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to them.	25	368	68	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3609	It is enough; to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. It implies everything amiable. I love him already.	1	369	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3610	I think you will like him when you know more of him.	2	369	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3611	Like him! I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.	3	369	69	replied	with a smile	f	f	f	f
3612	You may esteem him.	4	369	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3613	I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.	5	369	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3614	In a few months, my dear Marianne, Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but she will be happy.	1	370	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3615	Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?	2	370	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3616	My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward’s heart. But you look grave, Marianne; do you disapprove your sister’s choice?	3	370	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3617	Perhaps I may consider it with some surprise. Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet—he is not the kind of young man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward’s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!	4	370	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3618	He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you would give him Cowper.	5	370	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3619	Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke my heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility. Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He must have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm.	6	370	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3620	Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be different from hers!	7	370	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3621	What a pity it is, Elinor, that Edward should have no taste for drawing.	1	371	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3622	No taste for drawing!, why should you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right.	2	371	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3623	I hope, Marianne, you do not consider him as deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if that were your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.	4	371	70	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3624	Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable.	6	371	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3625	I am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.	7	371	70	replied	with a smile	f	f	f	f
3626	Of his sense and his goodness no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?	9	371	70	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3627	I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart.	10	371	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3628	I do not attempt to deny that I think very highly of him—that I greatly esteem, that I like him.	12	371	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3629	Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.	14	371	71	burst forth	with indignation	f	f	f	f
3630	Excuse me; and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion—the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel little—scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank.	15	371	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3631	And you really are not engaged to him! Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!	17	371	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3758	Indeed!	52	385	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3632	Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?	1	372	72	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3633	It is but a cottage, but I hope to see many of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them.	2	372	68	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3634	Dear, dear Norland! when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, ye well-known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!—No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy you?	1	373	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3635	As for the house itself, to be sure, it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.	1	374	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3636	But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be my father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect him?	1	375	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3637	Infirmity!, do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!	2	375	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3638	Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?	3	375	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3639	My dearest child, at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.	4	375	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3640	Mama, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.	5	375	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3641	Perhaps, thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think Colonel Brandon’s being thirty-five any objection to his marrying her.	6	375	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3642	A woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.	7	375	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3643	It would be impossible, I know, to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders.	8	375	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3644	But he talked of flannel waistcoats; and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.	9	375	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3645	Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him half so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?	10	375	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3646	Mama, I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else can detain him at Norland?	11	375	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3647	Had you any idea of his coming so soon? I had none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?	12	375	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3648	I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.	13	375	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3649	I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time.	14	375	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3650	How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together! In Edward’s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?	15	375	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3651	Is there a felicity in the world superior to this?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.	1	376	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3652	Willoughby!; what, is he in the country? That is good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.	1	377	67	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3653	You know him then.	2	377	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3654	Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year.	3	377	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3655	And what sort of a young man is he?	4	377	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3656	As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.	5	377	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3657	And is that all you can say for him? But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?	6	377	71	cried	indignantly	f	f	f	f
3658	Upon my soul, I do not know much about him as to all that. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with him today?	8	377	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3659	But who is he? Where does he come from? Has he a house at Allenham?	10	377	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3660	Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.	11	377	67	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
3661	I do not believe that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him. It is not an employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.	12	377	69	said	with a good humoured smile	f	f	f	f
3662	He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived. I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced from eight o’clock till four, without once sitting down.	13	377	67	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3663	Did he indeed? and with elegance, with spirit?	14	377	71	cried	with sparkling eyes	f	f	f	f
3664	Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.	15	377	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3665	That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.	16	377	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3667	That is an expression, Sir John, which I particularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and ‘setting one’s cap at a man,’ or ‘making a conquest,’ are the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.	18	377	71	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
3668	Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles.	20	377	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3669	Well, Marianne, for one morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby’s opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing farther to ask.	1	378	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3670	Elinor, is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful—had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared.	2	378	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3671	My love, you must not be offended with Elinor—she was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend.	3	378	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3672	Brandon is just the kind of man whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to.	1	379	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3673	That is exactly what I think of him.	2	379	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3674	Do not boast of it, however, for it is injustice in both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.	3	379	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3675	That he is patronised by you is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the indifference of any body else?	4	379	73	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3676	But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.	5	379	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3677	In defence of your protégé you can even be saucy.	6	379	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3678	My protégé, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.	7	379	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3679	That is to say, he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome.	8	379	71	cried	contemptuously	f	f	f	f
3680	He would have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.	9	379	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3681	Perhaps his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.	10	379	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3682	I may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour. But why should you dislike him?	11	379	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3683	I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very respectable man, who has every body’s good word, and nobody’s notice; who has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats every year.	12	379	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3684	Add to which that he has neither genius, taste, nor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice no expression.	13	379	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3685	You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass, and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.	14	379	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3686	Miss Dashwood, you are now using me unkindly. You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my will. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever.	15	379	73	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3687	Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments.	1	380	74	said	with a faint smile	f	f	f	f
3688	No, her opinions are all romantic.	2	380	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3689	Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.	3	380	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3690	I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.	4	380	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3691	This will probably be the case; and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.	5	380	74	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3692	I cannot agree with you there. There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne’s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage.	6	380	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3800	Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor, and with how heavy a heart does he travel?	1	391	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3693	Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?	8	380	74	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3694	Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles. I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment’s being pardonable.	9	380	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3695	This cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments—No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who from an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances—	10	380	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3696	He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it, and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall share its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop on some of these downs.	1	381	71	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3697	You are mistaken, Elinor, in supposing I know very little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.	2	381	71	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
3698	Oh, Elinor!, I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.	1	382	75	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3699	You have said so almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.	2	382	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3700	But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.	3	382	75	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3701	Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of his.	4	382	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3702	But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne’s. I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.	5	382	75	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3703	I must not tell, may I, Elinor?	1	383	75	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3704	Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to repeat them.	2	383	71	saying	in an angry manner	f	f	f	f
3705	I never had any conjectures about it; it was you who told me of it yourself.	5	383	75	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3706	Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it. What is the gentleman’s name?	7	383	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3707	I must not tell, ma’am. But I know very well what it is; and I know where he is too.	8	383	75	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3708	Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be sure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.	9	383	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3709	No, that he is not. He is of no profession at all.	10	383	75	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3710	Marianne, you know that all this is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in existence.	11	383	71	said	with great warmth	f	f	f	f
3711	Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins with an F.	12	383	75	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3712	that it rained very hard	13	383	77	observing	\N	f	f	f	f
3713	What is the matter with Brandon?	1	384	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3714	I hope he has had no bad news. It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly.	3	384	77	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3715	No bad news, Colonel, I hope.	1	385	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3716	None at all, ma’am, I thank you.	2	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3717	Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse.	3	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3718	No, ma’am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.	4	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3719	But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business? Come, come, this won’t do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.	5	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3720	My dear madam, recollect what you are saying.	6	385	77	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3721	Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?	7	385	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3722	No, indeed, it is not.	8	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3723	Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.	9	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3724	Whom do you mean, ma’am?	10	385	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3725	Oh! you know who I mean.	11	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3726	I am particularly sorry, ma’am, that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town.	12	385	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3727	In town! What can you have to do in town at this time of year?	13	385	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3728	My own loss is great, in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.	14	385	74	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3729	But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon, will it not be sufficient?	16	385	71	said	eagerly	f	f	f	f
3730	We must go—It shall not be put off when we are so near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.	18	385	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3731	I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!	19	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3732	If you would but let us know what your business is, we might see whether it could be put off or not.	20	385	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3733	You would not be six hours later, if you were to defer your journey till our return.	21	385	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3734	I cannot afford to lose one hour.	22	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3735	There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of them. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing.	23	385	73	say	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
3736	I have no doubt of it.	24	385	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3737	There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of old, when once you are determined on anything. But, however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.	25	385	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3738	Well, then, when will you come back again?	27	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3739	I hope we shall see you at Barton as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return.	28	385	76	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3740	You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.	29	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3741	Oh! he must and shall come back. If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go after him.	30	385	78	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3742	Ay, so do, Sir John, and then perhaps you may find out what his business is.	31	385	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3743	I do not want to pry into other men’s concerns. I suppose it is something he is ashamed of.	32	385	78	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3744	You do not go to town on horseback, do you?	34	385	78	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3745	No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.	35	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3746	Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you had better change your mind.	36	385	78	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3747	I assure you it is not in my power.	37	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3748	Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?	39	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3749	I am afraid, none at all.	40	385	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3750	Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do.	41	385	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3751	Come Colonel, before you go, do let us know what you are going about.	43	385	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3752	I can guess what his business is, however.	46	385	76	said	exultingly	f	f	f	f
3753	Can you, ma’am?	47	385	79	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3754	Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.	48	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3755	And who is Miss Williams?	49	385	71	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
3756	What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel’s, my dear; a very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.	50	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3757	She is his natural daughter.	51	385	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3759	Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune.	53	385	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3760	I have found you out in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.	1	386	76	said	loud enough for them both to hear	f	f	f	f
3761	Where, pray?	2	386	71	replied	very hastily	f	f	f	f
3762	Did not you know that we had been out in my curricle?	3	386	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3763	Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined to find out where you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago.	4	386	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3764	Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?	2	387	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3765	Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.	3	387	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3766	Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.	4	387	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3767	I am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety.	5	387	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3815	I confess that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement; but that one is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.	16	391	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3768	On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.	6	387	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3769	But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?	7	387	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3770	If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith’s grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one day be Mr. Willoughby’s, and—	8	387	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3771	If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be justified in what you have done.	9	387	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3772	Perhaps, Elinor, it was rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up—a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England.	10	387	71	said	with great good humor	f	f	f	f
3801	It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice—Gone too without intending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself. You must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?	2	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3773	Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure. I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know the truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her. May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over. His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.	1	388	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3774	What!—Improve this dear cottage! No. That I will never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded.	1	389	73	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
3775	Do not be alarmed, nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.	2	389	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3776	I am heartily glad of it. May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.	3	389	73	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3777	Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?	4	389	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3778	I am. To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage.	5	389	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3779	With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose.	6	389	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3780	Yes, with all and every thing belonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.	7	389	73	cried	in the same eager tone	f	f	f	f
3781	I flatter myself that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this.	8	389	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3782	There certainly are circumstances which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share.	9	389	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3783	How often did I wish when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it not have been so, Marianne?” speaking to her in a lowered voice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, “And yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.	11	389	73	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3784	You are a good woman. Your promise makes me easy. Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me.	13	389	73	replied	warmly	f	f	f	f
3785	Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner? I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.	15	389	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3786	Is anything the matter with her?—is she ill?	1	390	69	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3787	I hope not.	2	390	73	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3788	It is I who may rather expect to be ill—for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!	3	390	73	added	presently	f	f	f	f
3789	Disappointment?	4	390	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4606	And are they going farther westward?	15	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4614	Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?	1	473	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3790	Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.	5	390	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3791	To London!—and are you going this morning?	6	390	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3792	Almost this moment.	7	390	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3793	This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;—and her business will not detain you from us long I hope.	8	390	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3794	You are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth.	9	390	73	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3795	And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?	10	390	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3796	You are too good.	11	390	73	replied	only	f	f	f	f
3797	I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here immediately, because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.	13	390	69	spoke	first	f	f	f	f
3798	My engagements at present are of such a nature—that—I dare not flatter myself—	14	390	73	replied	confusedly	f	f	f	f
3799	It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy.	15	390	73	said	with a faint smile	f	f	f	f
4658	But William will write to you, I dare say.	5	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3802	It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see that. He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you.	3	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3803	Can you, indeed!	4	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3804	Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can—it will not satisfy you, I know; but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it. I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;—and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware that she does disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or may not have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?	5	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3805	Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.	6	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3806	Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter. You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what is it you suspect him of?	7	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3807	I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has. But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.	8	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3808	Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?—I am happy—and he is acquitted.	9	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3809	Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they are engaged) from Mrs. Smith—and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.	10	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3810	Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.	11	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3811	I want no proof of their affection; but of their engagement I do.	12	391	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3812	I am perfectly satisfied of both.	13	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3813	Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them.	14	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3814	I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation? Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How could such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister’s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?	15	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3842	Because among the rest of the objects before me, I see a very dirty lane.	13	395	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3816	How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?	17	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3817	No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.	18	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3818	But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.	19	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3819	You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.	20	391	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3820	A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister’s wishes. It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?	21	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3853	Strange that it would! What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?	7	396	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3854	Grandeur has but little, but wealth has much to do with it.	8	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3855	Elinor, for shame!, money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.	9	396	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3856	Perhaps, we may come to the same point. Your competence and my wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than mine. Come, what is your competence?	10	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3857	About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than that.	11	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3858	two thousand a year! one is my wealth! I guessed how it would end.	12	396	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4134	Nay, Elinor, this reproach from you—you who have confidence in no one!	8	420	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3821	I hope not, I believe not. I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his manners this morning;—he did not speak like himself, and did not return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;—but I will not raise objections against any one’s conduct on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.	22	391	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3822	You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected. Though we have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable.	23	391	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3823	Remember, Elinor, how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John’s hands.	1	392	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3824	Why do you not ask Marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would be the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially.	3	392	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3825	I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know Marianne’s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.	4	392	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3826	We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may be months, perhaps, before that happens.	1	393	69	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
3827	Months! No—nor many weeks.	2	393	71	cried	with strong surprise	f	f	f	f
3828	It is he; it is indeed;—I know it is!	1	394	71	exclaimed	rapturously	f	f	f	f
3829	Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.	2	394	70	cried	out	f	f	f	f
3830	He has, he has, I am sure he has. His air, his coat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come.	3	394	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3831	A fortnight!	1	395	71	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3832	Have you been lately in Sussex?	3	395	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3833	I was at Norland about a month ago.	4	395	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3834	And how does dear, dear Norland look?	5	395	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3835	Dear, dear Norland probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.	6	395	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3836	Oh, with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight.	7	395	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3837	It is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves.	8	395	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3838	No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But sometimes they are.	9	395	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3839	Now, Edward, here is Barton valley. Look up to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.	10	395	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3840	It is a beautiful country; but these bottoms must be dirty in winter.	11	395	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3841	How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?	12	395	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3843	Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant people?	15	395	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3844	No, not all; we could not be more unfortunately situated.	16	395	71	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
3845	Marianne, how can you say so? How can you be so unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?	17	395	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3846	No, nor how many painful moments.	18	395	71	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
3847	What are Mrs. Ferrars’s views for you at present, Edward?; are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?	1	396	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3848	No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!	2	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3849	But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.	3	396	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3850	I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.	4	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3851	You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.	5	396	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3852	As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.	6	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3859	And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income. A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.	13	396	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3860	Hunters!—but why must you have hunters? Every body does not hunt.	15	396	72	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
3861	But most people do.	16	396	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3862	I wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!	17	396	75	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3863	Oh that they would!	18	396	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3864	We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose, in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.	19	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3865	Oh dear!, how happy I should be! I wonder what I should do with it!	20	396	75	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3866	I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself, if my children were all to be rich without my help.	22	396	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3867	You must begin your improvements on this house, and your difficulties will soon vanish.	23	396	70	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
3868	What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her. And books!—Thomson, Cowper, Scott—she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very saucy. But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes.	24	396	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3870	And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs.	26	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3872	Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?	28	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3874	Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see, she is not at all altered.	30	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3873	Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.	29	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3871	No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.	27	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3869	I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.	25	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3875	She is only grown a little more grave than she was.	31	396	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3876	Nay, Edward, you need not reproach me. You are not very gay yourself.	32	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3877	Why should you think so! But gaiety never was a part of my character.	33	396	72	replied	with a sigh	f	f	f	f
3878	Nor do I think it a part of Marianne’s; I should hardly call her a lively girl—she is very earnest, very eager in all she does—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she is not often really merry.	34	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3879	I believe you are right, and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl.	35	396	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3890	Yes, very.	46	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3880	I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.	36	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3881	But I thought it was right, Elinor, to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has always been your doctrine, I am sure.	37	396	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3882	No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?	38	396	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3883	You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility, Do you gain no ground?	39	396	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3884	Quite the contrary.	40	396	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3885	My judgment is all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister’s. I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!	41	396	72	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
3886	Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers.	42	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3887	She knows her own worth too well for false shame. Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy.	43	396	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3888	But you would still be reserved, and that is worse.	44	396	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3889	Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?	45	396	72	started	\N	f	f	f	f
3891	I do not understand you. Reserved!—how, in what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?	47	396	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3892	Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?	48	396	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3893	I am going into the village to see my horses, as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.	1	397	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3919	I think that I may defy many months to produce any good to me.	6	401	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3920	Well, we have brought you some strangers. How do you like them?	1	402	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3921	Hush! they will hear you.	2	402	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3922	Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.	3	402	78	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3894	You must not enquire too far, Marianne—remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very fine country—the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing of the picturesque.	1	398	72	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
3895	I am afraid it is but too true; but why should you boast of it?	2	398	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3896	I suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.	3	398	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3897	It is very true that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.	4	398	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3898	I am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower—and a troop of tidy, happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world.	5	398	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3899	I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward. Is that Fanny’s hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should have thought her hair had been darker.	8	398	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3900	Yes; it is my sister’s hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.	9	398	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3901	You must drink tea with us to night, for we shall be quite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.	1	399	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3902	And who knows but you may raise a dance. And that will tempt you, Miss Marianne.	2	399	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3903	A dance! Impossible! Who is to dance?	3	399	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3904	Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.—What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!	4	399	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3905	I wish with all my soul that Willoughby were among us again.	5	399	78	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3906	And who is Willoughby?	6	399	72	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
3907	I have been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?	1	400	72	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
3909	Shall I tell you?	3	400	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3911	Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.	5	400	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3912	Oh, Edward! How can you?—But the time will come I hope...I am sure you will like him.	7	400	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3908	What do you mean?	2	400	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3913	I do not doubt it.	8	400	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4022	Four years!	17	408	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4035	Four years you have been engaged.	32	408	70	said	with a firm voice	f	f	f	f
3914	I think, Edward, you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it—you would not be able to give them so much of your time. But you would be materially benefited in one particular at least—you would know where to go when you left them.	1	401	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3915	I do assure you that I have long thought on this point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since.	2	401	72	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3916	The consequence of which, I suppose, will be, since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades as Columella’s.	3	401	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3917	They will be brought up to be as unlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing.	4	401	72	said	in a serious accent	f	f	f	f
3918	Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits, Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but patience—or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. How much may not a few months do?	5	401	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4660	And when shall you do it?	7	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3925	How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs. Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea, but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again—	7	402	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3926	Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so charming! Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! I always thought it such a sweet place, ma’am! but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not you, Mr. Palmer?	11	402	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3927	Mr. Palmer does not hear me; he never does sometimes. It is so ridiculous!	13	402	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3928	You may believe how glad we all were to see them; but, however, I can’t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!	16	402	76	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3929	She expects to be confined in February.	18	402	76	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3930	No, none at all.	20	402	81	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3931	Here comes Marianne. Now, Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.	21	402	78	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3932	Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever.	23	402	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3933	My love, have you been asleep?	25	402	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3934	Why should they ask us? The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us.	1	403	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3935	They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now, by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.	2	403	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3936	I am so glad to see you!, for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.	1	404	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3937	Not go to town! I shall be quite disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in the world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.	3	404	80	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3938	Oh, my love—you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter.	5	404	80	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4023	Yes.	18	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4036	Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor Edward! It puts him quite out of heart.	33	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3939	How horrid all this is! Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain. It makes one detest all one’s acquaintance. What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house? How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the weather.	7	404	81	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3940	I am afraid, Miss Marianne, you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today.	9	404	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3941	Oh, don’t be so sly before us; for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.	11	404	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3942	Much nearer thirty.	12	404	81	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3943	Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet pretty place.	13	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3944	As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life.	14	404	81	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3945	Is it very ugly?—then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose.	16	404	80	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3946	My dear, it is very provoking that we should be so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?	18	404	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3947	Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before, that it could not be done? They dined with us last.	19	404	77	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3948	You and I, Sir John, should not stand upon such ceremony.	20	404	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3949	Then you would be very ill-bred.	21	404	81	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3950	My love you contradict every body. Do you know that you are quite rude?	22	404	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3951	I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred.	23	404	81	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3952	Ay, you may abuse me as you please, you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again. So there I have the whip hand of you.	24	404	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3953	Mr. Palmer is so droll! He is always out of humour.	26	404	80	said	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
3954	Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood, I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,—and come while the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be! It will be quite delightful!—My love, don’t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?	28	404	80	said	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
3955	Certainly—I came into Devonshire with no other view.	29	404	81	replied	with a sneer	f	f	f	f
3956	There now—you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come.	30	404	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3957	But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful. You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.	32	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4663	Yes, very.	10	481	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3958	How charming it will be when he is in Parliament!—won’t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know, he says, he will never frank for me? He declares he won’t. Don’t you, Mr. Palmer?	34	404	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3959	He cannot bear writing, you know—he says it is quite shocking.	36	404	80	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3960	No, I never said any thing so irrational. Don’t palm all your abuses of language upon me.	37	404	81	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3961	There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him! Sometimes he won’t speak to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world.	38	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3962	Certainly; he seems very agreeable.	40	404	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3963	Well—I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can’t think how disappointed he will be if you don’t come to Cleveland.—I can’t imagine why you should object to it.	41	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3964	Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well; Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before;—but I was with my uncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together. He is very little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about him, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.	43	404	80	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3965	Upon my word, you know much more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.	44	404	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3966	Don’t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.	45	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3967	My dear Mrs. Palmer!	46	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3968	Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.	47	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3969	You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do.	48	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4026	Your uncle!	22	408	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4037	To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for.—I have had it above these three years.	34	408	70	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4038	I have never been able to give him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity.	36	408	82	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4040	I am sure I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman.	38	408	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4114	Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.	11	414	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3970	But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how it happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another, and I said to him, ‘So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in Devonshire so lately.’	49	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3971	And what did the Colonel say?	50	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3972	Oh—he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite delightful, I declare! When is it to take place?	51	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3973	Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?	52	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3974	Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but say fine things of you.	53	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3975	I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.	54	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3976	So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull. Mama says he was in love with your sister too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body.	55	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3977	Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?	56	404	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3978	Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don’t think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him to own it last night.	57	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3979	I am so glad we are got acquainted at last—And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can’t think how much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.	59	404	80	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
3980	You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?	60	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3981	Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular friend of Sir John’s. I believe he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.	61	404	80	added	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
3982	Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John’s proposal to your mother before it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?	62	404	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4135	Me! indeed, Marianne, I have nothing to tell.	9	420	70	returned	in some confusion	f	f	f	f
3983	Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have liked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.	63	404	80	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3984	Do come now—pray come—you must come—I declare you shall come—You can’t think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come? Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. You are my cousins, and they are my wife’s, so you must be related.	1	405	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3985	John is in such spirits today!—He is full of monkey tricks.	1	406	77	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3986	How playful William is!	2	406	77	observed	fondly	f	f	f	f
3987	And here is my sweet little Annamaria; And she is always so gentle and quiet—Never was there such a quiet little thing!	3	406	77	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3989	Yet I hardly know how, unless it had been under totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.	2	407	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3990	What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!	3	407	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3993	I should guess so, from what I have witnessed this morning.	8	407	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3994	I have a notion you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.	9	407	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3995	I confess that while I am at Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.	10	407	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
3998	We have heard Sir John admire it excessively.	14	407	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3988	Poor little creatures! It might have been a very sad accident.	1	407	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
3991	And Sir John too, what a charming man he is!	5	407	83	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
3992	And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.	7	407	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
3996	And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.	11	407	83	said	rather abruptly	f	f	f	f
3997	Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?	13	407	83	added	\N	f	f	f	f
3999	I think every one must admire it who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do.	15	407	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4000	And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast addition always.	16	407	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4001	But why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?	17	407	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4034	No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore, there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister’s suspecting any thing, that was reason enough for his not mentioning it.	30	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4002	Nay, my dear, I’m sure I don’t pretend to say that there an’t. I’m sure there’s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil. But I can’t bear to see them dirty and nasty. Now there’s Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?	18	407	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4003	Upon my word, I cannot tell you, for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him.	19	407	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4004	Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men’s being beaux—they have something else to do.	20	407	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4005	Lord! Anne, you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.	21	407	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4006	’Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure, and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,—but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already.	25	407	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4007	His name is Ferrars; but pray do not tell it, for it’s a great secret.	28	407	78	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4008	Ferrars!; Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law’s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure; I know him very well.	29	407	83	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4009	How can you say so, Anne? Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle’s, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.	30	407	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4010	You will think my question an odd one, I dare say—but pray, are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law’s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?	1	408	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4011	Indeed!; I wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?	3	408	82	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4012	No; I know nothing of her.	4	408	70	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
4013	I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a way; but perhaps there may be reasons—I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.	5	408	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4072	But what are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars’s death, which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?—Is her son determined to submit to this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?	13	410	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4665	But, cousin, will it go to the post?	12	481	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4014	I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting you; indeed, I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble you. I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.	7	408	82	saying	with some hesitation	f	f	f	f
4015	I am sorry I do not, if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her. But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.	8	408	70	said	in great astonishment	f	f	f	f
4016	I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present—but the time may come—how soon it will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately connected.	9	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4017	Good heavens!, what do you mean? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?	11	408	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4018	No, not to Mr. Robert Ferrars—I never saw him in my life; but, to his eldest brother.	12	408	82	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4019	You may well be surprised; for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters.	14	408	82	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4020	May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?	15	408	70	said	with calmness of manner	f	f	f	f
4021	We have been engaged these four years.	16	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4024	I did not know that you were even acquainted till the other day.	20	408	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4025	Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my uncle’s care, you know, a considerable while.	21	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4027	Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?	23	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4028	I think I have.	24	408	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4029	He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.	25	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4030	Certainly.	26	408	70	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
4031	Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.	27	408	70	added	with revived security of Edward’s honour and love	f	f	f	f
4032	We can mean no other Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends.	28	408	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4033	It is strange that I should never have heard him even mention your name.	29	408	70	replied	in a most painful perplexity	f	f	f	f
4039	You are quite in the right.	37	408	70	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
4041	I certainly did not seek your confidence; but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety.	39	408	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4042	I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward’s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t’other day, when Edward’s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all. You can’t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward’s sake these last four years. Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom—we can hardly meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.	41	408	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4043	Sometimes, I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely. But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing would do. And on my own account too—so dear as he is to me—I don’t think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?	43	408	82	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4044	Pardon me; but I can give you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct you.	44	408	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4045	To be sure, his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.	45	408	82	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4046	Did he come from your uncle’s, then, when he visited us?	46	408	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4047	Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he came directly from town?	47	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4048	No, I remember he told us, that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.	48	408	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4051	I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor fellow! I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter. You know his hand, I dare say,—a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.	51	408	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4052	Writing to each other is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even that. If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture. Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?	53	408	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4053	I did.	54	408	70	said	with a composure of voice	f	f	f	f
4054	I am glad you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria’s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.	1	409	77	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4055	Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am resolved to finish the basket after supper.	2	409	82	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4056	You are very good, I hope it won’t hurt your eyes—will you ring the bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon having it done.	3	409	77	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4057	Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me—you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned.	5	409	71	exclaimed	with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility	f	f	f	f
4058	Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma’am; and I do not much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.	7	409	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4059	Perhaps if I should happen to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.	9	409	70	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4060	Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help, for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.	10	409	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4061	Oh! that would be terrible, indeed. Dear little soul, how I do love her!	11	409	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4062	You are very kind; and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?	12	409	77	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4063	I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.	1	410	70	began	\N	f	f	f	f
4064	Thank you for breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday.	2	410	82	cried	warmly	f	f	f	f
4065	Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me, nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?	3	410	70	spoke	with the truest sincerity	f	f	f	f
4393	I am so glad to meet you;—for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.	3	453	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4066	And yet I do assure you, there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure.	4	410	82	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4067	Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.	5	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4068	He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must wait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward’s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know.	6	410	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4069	That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your’s. If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years’ engagement, your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.	7	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4070	Edward’s love for me has been pretty well put to the test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment’s alarm on that account from the first.	9	410	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4071	I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived.	11	410	82	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
4130	It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!	4	420	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4131	You are expecting a letter, then?	5	420	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4073	If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and the idea of that, for Edward’s sake, frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures.	14	410	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4074	And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason.	15	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4075	Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?	17	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4076	Not at all—I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother—silly and a great coxcomb.	18	410	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4077	A great coxcomb! Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say.	19	410	83	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4078	No sister, you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs.	20	410	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4079	I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood’s is not; for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature, there is no finding out who she likes.	21	410	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4080	Oh, I dare say Lucy’s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood’s.	22	410	83	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4081	I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.	24	410	82	saying	in a lower tone	f	f	f	f
4082	I should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood—that must be recommendation enough to her husband.	25	410	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4083	But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward’s going into orders.	26	410	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4084	Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.	27	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4085	I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we should be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?	29	410	82	exclaimed	with a deep sigh	f	f	f	f
4086	No, on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.	30	410	70	answered	with a smile, which concealed very agitated feelings	f	f	f	f
4087	Indeed you wrong me; I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe, that if you was to say to me, ‘I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be more for the happiness of both of you,’ I should resolve upon doing it immediately.	31	410	82	replied	with great solemnity	f	f	f	f
4088	This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person.	32	410	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4113	Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does Charlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.	10	414	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4089	’Tis because you are an indifferent person that your judgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.	33	410	82	said	with some pique	f	f	f	f
4090	Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?	35	410	82	said	with all her accustomary complacency	f	f	f	f
4091	Certainly not.	36	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4092	I am sorry for that, it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your brother and sister will ask you to come to them.	37	410	82	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
4093	It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.	38	410	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4094	How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there. Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.	39	410	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4095	Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I do beg you will favour me with your company, for I’ve quite set my heart upon it. Don’t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan’t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford that. We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men, you may depend upon it.	1	411	76	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4096	I have a notion that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it.	2	411	78	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4097	Nay, I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne’s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk to one another, and laugh at my odd ways behind my back. But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye, why so much the better.	3	411	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4132	Yes, a little—not much.	6	420	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4133	You have no confidence in me, Marianne.	7	420	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4667	My uncle!	14	481	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4098	I thank you, ma’am, sincerely thank you: your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,—I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made less happy, less comfortable by our absence—Oh! no, nothing should tempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle.	4	411	71	said	with warmth	f	f	f	f
4099	I am delighted with the plan, it is exactly what I could wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves. When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you should go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other.	1	412	69	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4100	Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness, you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so easily removed.”	2	412	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4101	And what is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it.	4	412	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4102	My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings’s heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give us consequence.	5	412	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4103	That is very true, but of her society, separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton.	6	412	69	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4104	If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings, at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation. I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.	7	412	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4105	I will have you both go; these objections are nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law’s family.	9	412	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4106	I am writing home, Marianne; had not you better defer your letter for a day or two?	1	413	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4107	I am not going to write to my mother.	2	413	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4108	Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!	1	414	71	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
4109	Is your sister ill?	3	414	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4110	Yes, almost ever since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in my power to return to Barton.	6	414	74	replied	with some embarrassment	f	f	f	f
4111	Oh! Colonel, I am monstrous glad to see you—sorry I could not come before—beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today?	8	414	76	said	with her usual noisy cheerfulness	f	f	f	f
4112	I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer’s, where I have been dining.	9	414	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4115	Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies with me, you see—that is, you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too—which you will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very handsome—worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don’t know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has been dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let’s have no secrets among friends.	12	414	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4116	Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you; What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was now, but it was something so droll!	1	415	80	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4117	Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?	1	416	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4118	Are you quite sure of it? Are you certain that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?	2	416	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4119	How very odd!	4	416	71	said	in a low and disappointed voice	f	f	f	f
4120	If this open weather holds much longer, Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week; ’tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day’s pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart.	1	417	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4121	That is true. I had not thought of that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.	2	417	71	cried	in a cheerful voice	f	f	f	f
4122	It is charming weather for them indeed. How much they must enjoy it! But it cannot be expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!	3	417	71	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4123	At any rate, I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.	4	417	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4124	Ay, my dear, I’ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.	5	417	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4125	Don’t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear afternoon.	1	418	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4126	Good God! he has been here while we were out.	1	419	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4127	Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.	2	419	70	ventured to say	\N	f	f	f	f
4128	For me!	1	420	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4129	No, ma’am, for my mistress.	2	420	84	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4136	No I, our situations then are alike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.	10	420	71	answered	with energy	f	f	f	f
4137	I thought you were both in Devonshire.	1	421	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4138	Did you?	2	421	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4139	When do you go back again?	3	421	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4140	I do not know.	4	421	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4141	Aye, aye, we know the reason of all that very well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.	1	422	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4142	Invited!	2	422	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4143	So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning.	3	422	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4144	your sister’s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known.	1	423	74	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4145	It cannot be generally known, for her own family do not know it.	2	423	70	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
4146	I beg your pardon, I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of.	3	423	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4147	How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?	4	423	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4148	By many—by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister’s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it impossible to—? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains.	5	423	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4149	to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her.	7	423	74	saying	in a voice of emotion	f	f	f	f
4150	Good heavens! he is there—he is there—Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?	1	424	71	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
4151	Pray, pray be composed, and do not betray what you feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.	2	424	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4152	Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?	4	424	71	exclaimed	in a voice of the greatest emotion	f	f	f	f
4153	I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.	6	424	73	spoke	with calmness	f	f	f	f
4154	But have you not received my notes? Here is some mistake I am sure—some dreadful mistake. What can be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven’s sake tell me, what is the matter?	7	424	71	cried	in the wildest anxiety	f	f	f	f
4155	Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me.	8	424	73	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4156	Go to him, Elinor, and force him to come to me. Tell him I must see him again—must speak to him instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall not have a moment’s peace till this is explained—some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him this moment.	10	424	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4157	How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.	11	424	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4158	Marianne, may I ask—?	1	425	70	said	in a tone of the most considerate gentleness	f	f	f	f
4159	No, Elinor, ask nothing; you will soon know all.	2	425	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4160	Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life! My girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won’t keep her waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn. Pray, when are they to be married?	1	426	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4161	And have you really, Ma’am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister’s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive yourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married.	2	426	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4162	For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don’t we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes? Come, come, this won’t do. Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so long. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.	3	426	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4163	Indeed, Ma’am, you are mistaken. Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.	4	426	70	said	very seriously	f	f	f	f
4164	Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!	1	427	71	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4165	I only wish there were any thing I could do, which might be of comfort to you.	2	427	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4166	Oh! Elinor, I am miserable, indeed.	3	427	71	exclaim	in the anguish of her heart	f	f	f	f
4167	Exert yourself, dear Marianne, if you would not kill yourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her misery while you suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.	5	427	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4168	I cannot, I cannot; leave me, leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so. Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, you cannot have an idea of what I suffer.	6	427	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4169	Do you call me happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew!—And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!	7	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4380	Well may you wonder, Marianne, at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very natural.	7	452	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4170	Forgive me, forgive me; I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are—you must be happy; Edward loves you—what, oh what, can do away such happiness as that?	8	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4171	Many, many circumstances.	9	427	70	said	solemnly	f	f	f	f
4172	No, no, no, he loves you, and only you. You can have no grief.	10	427	71	cried	wildly	f	f	f	f
4173	I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.	11	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4174	And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing can do away.	12	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4175	You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period—if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.	13	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4176	Engagement!, there has been no engagement.	14	427	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4177	No engagement!	15	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4178	No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith with me.	16	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4179	But he told you that he loved you.	17	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4180	Yes—no—never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never professedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been, but it never was.	18	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4181	Yet you wrote to him?	19	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4182	Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot talk.	20	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4183	I felt myself to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.	39	427	71	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4184	I can believe it; but unfortunately he did not feel the same.	40	427	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4185	He did feel the same, Elinor—for weeks and weeks he felt it. I know he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again—his distress—can I ever forget his distress?	41	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4186	Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.	43	427	71	added	in a firmer tone	f	f	f	f
4187	Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been instigated?	44	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4188	By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This woman of whom he writes—whoever she be—or any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?	45	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4189	Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.	46	427	70	replied	only	f	f	f	f
4190	No, no, misery such as mine has no pride. I care not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like—may resist insult, or return mortification—but I cannot. I must feel—I must be wretched—and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.	47	427	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4191	But for my mother’s sake and mine—	48	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4192	I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so miserable—Oh! who can require it?	49	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4193	It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours! Cruel, cruel—nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he might have heard against me—ought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing myself? ‘The lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me’—That is unpardonable. Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh, barbarously insolent!—Elinor, can he be justified?	51	427	71	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
4194	No, Marianne, in no possible way.	52	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4195	And yet this woman—who knows what her art may have been?—how long it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is she?—Who can she be?—Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?—Oh! no one, no one—he talked to me only of myself.	53	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4196	Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be gone to-morrow?	55	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4197	To-morrow, Marianne!	56	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4198	Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby’s sake—and now who cares for me? Who regards me?	57	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4199	It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that.	58	427	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4200	Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people. The Middletons and Palmers—how am I to bear their pity? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would he say to that!	59	427	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4201	How do you do my dear?	1	428	76	said	in a voice of great compassion	f	f	f	f
4242	I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street, and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object—my wish—my sole wish in desiring it—I hope, I believe it is—is to be a means of giving comfort;—no, I must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction, lasting conviction to your sister’s mind. My regard for her, for yourself, for your mother—will you allow me to prove it, by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard—nothing but an earnest desire of being useful—I think I am justified—though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?	7	437	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4407	Well, it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst. You have got your answer ready.	19	453	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4202	How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No wonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon—a good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I have no notion of men’s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won’t disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her.	2	428	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4203	no, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.	1	429	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4204	Poor soul!, how it grieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care no more about such things!—	1	430	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4205	The lady then—Miss Grey I think you called her—is very rich?	2	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4206	Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won’t come before it’s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don’t signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to have him. Why don’t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round. But that won’t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.	3	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4207	Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be amiable?	4	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4208	I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree.	5	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4209	And who are the Ellisons?	6	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4210	Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now—your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it seems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at? She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?	7	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4211	Dear ma’am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.	8	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4212	Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own supper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came today finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know, how should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see them tomorrow.	9	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4394	I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is she angry?	4	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4213	It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe.	10	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4214	Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time. No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such things, the better, the sooner ’tis blown over and forgot. And what good does talking ever do you know?	11	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4215	In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the public conversation. I must do this justice to Mr. Willoughby—he has broken no positive engagement with my sister.	12	430	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4216	Law, my dear! Don’t pretend to defend him. No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter!	13	430	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4243	I understand you. You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. My gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and hers must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me hear it.	8	437	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4244	You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,—but this will give you no idea—I must go farther back. You will find me a very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it shall be a short one. On such a subject can I have little temptation to be diffuse.	9	437	74	sighing	heavily	f	f	f	f
4428	He spoke of its being out of repair.	8	460	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4429	Well, and whose fault is that? why don’t he repair it?—who should do it but himself?	9	460	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4217	Well, my dear, ’tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye, that he will. Mind me, now, if they an’t married by Mid-summer. Lord! how he’ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will be all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without debt or drawback—except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be ’prenticed out at a small cost, and then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road, so ’tis never dull, for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. Oh! ’tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone’s throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we can but put Willoughby out of her head!	15	430	76	burst forth	again	f	f	f	f
4218	Ay, if we can do that, Ma’am, we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon.	16	430	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4219	You had better leave me.	1	431	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4220	I will leave you if you will go to bed.	2	431	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4221	My dear, I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world. Do take it to your sister.	1	432	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4222	Dear Ma'am, how good you are! But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself.	2	432	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4223	The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.	1	433	76	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
4224	Marianne is not well. She has been indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.	1	434	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4225	Perhaps, then, what I heard this morning may be—there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first.	2	434	74	replied	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
4226	What did you hear?	3	434	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4227	That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think—in short, that a man, whom I knew to be engaged—but how shall I tell you? If you know it already, as surely you must, I may be spared.	4	434	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4228	You mean Mr. Willoughby’s marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we do know it all. This seems to have been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?	5	434	70	answered	with forced calmness	f	f	f	f
4229	In a stationer’s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing, especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still more:—as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!—but it would be impossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey’s guardian.	6	434	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4230	It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.	7	434	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4231	It may be so; but Willoughby is capable—at least I think	8	434	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4232	And your sister—how did she—	9	434	74	added	in a voice which seemed to distrust itself	f	f	f	f
4233	Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now, perhaps—but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.	10	434	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4234	Ah!, there is, indeed! But your sister does not—I think you said so—she does not consider quite as you do?	11	434	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4235	You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could.	12	434	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4396	That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is she angry?	6	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4236	No, no, no, it cannot be; she cannot feel. Her kindness is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.	1	435	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4237	Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.	1	436	76	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4238	Who can this be? So early too! I thought we had been safe.	1	437	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4239	It is Colonel Brandon! We are never safe from him.	3	437	71	said	with vexation	f	f	f	f
4240	He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.	4	437	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4241	I will not trust to that. A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others.	5	437	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4245	You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation—(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park—it was the evening of a dance—in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne.	11	437	74	went on	with another sign	f	f	f	f
4246	Indeed, I have not forgotten it.	12	437	70	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
4247	If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married—married against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing—but how blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin’s maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father’s point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon’s, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,” he continued, in a voice of great agitation, “was of trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce. It was that which threw this gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—	13	437	74	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4457	Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!	7	462	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4248	It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England. My first care, when I did arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I did find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her—but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage of a consumption, was—yes, in such a situation it was my greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last moments.	15	437	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4249	Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for fourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all! I will be more collected—more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter—better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter’s being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.	17	437	74	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4250	Good heavens!, could it be—could Willoughby!	18	437	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4277	I wished very much to call upon you yesterday, but it was impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars. Harry was vastly pleased. This morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to them. As my mother-in-law’s relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand.	1	439	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4251	The first news that reached me of her came in a letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable; but had he known it, what would it have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who can feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her.	19	437	74	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4252	This is beyond every thing!	20	437	70	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
4253	His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it was known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister—but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister’s influence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.	21	437	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4254	I have been more pained by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have you ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?	23	437	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4255	Yes, once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.	24	437	74	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
4256	What? have you met him to—	26	437	70	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4257	I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.	27	437	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4258	Such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!	29	437	74	said	after a pause	f	f	f	f
4259	Is she still in town?	30	437	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4260	No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there she remains.	31	437	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4261	I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here still. But I always thought I should. I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile; though you told me, you know, at Barton, that you should not stay above a month. But I thought, at the time, that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone. I am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word.	1	438	82	said	repeatedly	f	f	f	f
4262	Well, my dear, and how did you travel?	3	438	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4263	Not in the stage, I assure you; we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to attend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we’d join him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did.	4	438	83	replied	with quick exultation	f	f	f	f
4264	Oh, oh! very pretty, indeed!; and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you.	5	438	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4265	There now, everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour’s end to another. ‘Lord! here comes your beau, Nancy,’ my cousin said t’other day, when she saw him crossing the street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I—I cannot think who you mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine.	6	438	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4266	Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking—but it won’t do—the Doctor is the man, I see.	7	438	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4267	No, indeed!, and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.	8	438	83	replied	with affected earnestness	f	f	f	f
4268	I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town.	10	438	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4269	No, I do not think we shall.	11	438	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4270	Oh, yes, I dare say you will.	12	438	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4271	What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together!	14	438	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4272	Long a time, indeed! Why, their visit is but just begun!	15	438	76	interposed	\N	f	f	f	f
4273	I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood. I am sorry she is not well—	17	438	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4274	You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.	18	438	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4275	Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I think she might see us; and I am sure we would not speak a word.	19	438	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4276	Oh, if that’s all, we can just as well go and see her.	21	438	83	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4278	Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness in every particular, is more than I can express.	2	439	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4279	I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed. But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it, I assure you.	3	439	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4280	but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.	1	440	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4281	Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?	1	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4282	Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.	2	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4283	I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life.	3	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4284	Me, brother! what do you mean?	4	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4285	He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What is the amount of his fortune?	5	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4286	I believe about two thousand a year.	6	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4287	Two thousand a-year	7	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4288	Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were twice as much, for your sake.	8	441	67	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4289	Indeed I believe you; but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me.	9	441	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4290	You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends may all advise him against it. But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side—in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable—you have too much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family. It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that will be exceedingly welcome to all parties.	10	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4535	Your wife!—The letter was in your own hand-writing.	61	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4291	That is, I mean to say—your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day.	11	441	67	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4292	It would be something remarkable, now, something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time. And yet it is not very unlikely.	13	441	67	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4293	Is Mr. Edward Ferrars going to be married?	14	441	70	said	with resolution	f	f	f	f
4294	It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. He has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give you another instance of her liberality:—The other day, as soon as we came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes into Fanny’s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great expense while we are here.	15	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4295	Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable; but your income is a large one.	17	441	70	say	\N	f	f	f	f
4296	Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his convenience; and it has cost me a vast deal of money.	18	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4297	More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.	19	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4298	Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker’s hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.	20	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4299	Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars’s kindness is.	22	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4300	Certainly; and assisted by her liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.	23	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4301	Another year or two may do much towards it; but however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone laid of Fanny’s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out.	24	441	67	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
4302	Where is the green-house to be?	25	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4303	Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow.	26	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4332	I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I should be sorry to have you ill; you, that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship.	10	445	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4397	I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.	7	453	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4304	She seems a most valuable woman indeed. Her house, her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.	29	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4305	Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her jointure, which will descend to her children.	30	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4306	But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.	31	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4307	And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?	32	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4308	Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.	33	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4309	But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.	34	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4310	Why, to be sure, people have little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?—she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?	35	441	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4311	She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks.	36	441	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4312	I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She was as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of you, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I question whether Marianne now, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if you do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.	37	441	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4313	I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny. Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant as her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.	1	442	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4314	Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!—there is nobody here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good gracious! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on—that is to be my mother!	1	443	82	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4315	These are done by my eldest sister; and you, as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.	1	444	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4316	Hum—very pretty.	3	444	85	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4317	They are very pretty, ma’am—an’t they?	5	444	68	said	immediately	f	f	f	f
4318	Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton’s style of painting, Ma’am?—She does paint most delightfully!—How beautifully her last landscape is done!	6	444	68	added	presently	f	f	f	f
4319	Beautifully indeed! But she does every thing well.	7	444	85	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4320	This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to us?—who knows, or who cares, for her?—it is Elinor of whom we think and speak.	9	444	71	say	immediately, with warmth	f	f	f	f
4321	Miss Morton is Lord Morton’s daughter.	11	444	85	pronounced	\N	f	f	f	f
4322	Dear, dear Elinor, don’t mind them. Don’t let them make you unhappy.	14	444	71	said	in a low, but eager, voice	f	f	f	f
4323	Ah! poor dear.	15	444	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4324	Poor Marianne! She has not such good health as her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor’s constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne was remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now you see it is all gone.	17	444	67	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
4325	My dear friend, I come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars’s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable as she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to me. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?	1	445	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4326	She was certainly very civil to you.	2	445	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4327	Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride, no hauteur, and your sister just the same—all sweetness and affability!	3	445	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4328	Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement, nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was not the case—	5	445	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4329	I guessed you would say so—but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan’t talk me out of my satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women, indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was!	6	445	82	replied	quickly	f	f	f	f
4330	Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?—you seem low—you don’t speak;—sure you an’t well.	8	445	82	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4331	I never was in better health.	9	445	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4607	Yes, ma’am—but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and then they’d be sure and call here.	16	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4333	Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to Edward’s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward! But now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often, for Lady Middleton’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his time with his sister—besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are such charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak too high.	12	445	82	replied	directly	f	f	f	f
4334	I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way—you know what I mean—if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where she does dislike, I know it is most violent.	14	445	82	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4335	Dear Edward!, this is a moment of great happiness!—This would almost make amends for every thing!	1	446	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4336	Oh, don’t think of me!	3	446	71	replied	with spirited earnestness	f	f	f	f
4337	don’t think of my health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.	4	446	71	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
4338	Do you like London?	6	446	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4339	Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you are what you always were!	7	446	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4340	I think, Elinor, we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.	9	446	71	added	presently	f	f	f	f
4341	We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.	11	446	71	talked	\N	f	f	f	f
4342	But why were you not there, Edward?—Why did you not come?	13	446	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4343	I was engaged elsewhere.	14	446	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4344	Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?	15	446	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4345	Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them, little as well as great.	16	446	82	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4346	Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.	18	446	71	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
4347	Going so soon!; my dear Edward, this must not be.	20	446	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4348	What can bring her here so often? Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward!	1	447	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4349	Why so?—we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves.	2	447	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4350	You know, Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted.	3	447	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4351	Upon my soul, I believe it is nothing more; and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. ‘My dear Madam,’ I always say to her, ‘you must make yourself easy. The evil is now irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his life? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt’s, all this would have been prevented.’ This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.	1	448	86	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4352	You reside in Devonshire, I think, in a cottage near Dawlish.	3	448	86	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4353	For my own part, I am excessively fond of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest, if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice, and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi’s. I was to decide on the best of them. ‘My dear Courtland,’ said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, ‘do not adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.’ And that I fancy, will be the end of it.	5	448	86	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4354	Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend Elliott’s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. ‘But how can it be done?’ said she; ‘my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?’ I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it, so I said, ‘My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the saloon.’ Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.	6	448	86	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4355	I do not see how it can be done,” said she, “without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But they are Lady Middleton’s visitors. How can I ask them away from her?	1	449	68	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4356	They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations.	2	449	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4357	My love, I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power. But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them; indeed, you do like them, you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!	4	449	68	said	with fresh vigor	f	f	f	f
4358	Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?	1	450	76	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4359	No, ma’am. What is it?	2	450	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4360	Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr. Palmer’s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was sure it was very ill—it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly, and, ‘Lord! my dear,’ says I, ‘it is nothing in the world, but the red gum;’ and nurse said just the same. But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, ‘For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister’s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.’	3	450	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4361	What! is Fanny ill?	4	450	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4362	That is exactly what I said, my dear. ‘Lord!’ says I, ‘is Mrs. Dashwood ill?’ So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!—There’s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it! That is strange! I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out. ‘Lord!’ thinks she to herself, ‘they are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;’ and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord’s daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother’s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity her. And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. Then she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people’s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.	5	450	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4363	How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?	1	451	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4364	I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.	2	451	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4365	Four months!—Have you known of this four months?	4	451	71	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
4366	What! while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart? And I have reproached you for being happy!	6	451	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4367	It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!	7	451	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4368	Four months! So calm! so cheerful! How have you been supported?	7	451	71	cried	again	f	f	f	f
4369	By feeling that I was doing my duty.—My promise to Lucy, obliged me to be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy.	9	451	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4370	I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother; and once or twice I have attempted it;—but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you.	11	451	70	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4371	Four months! and yet you loved him!	12	451	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4372	Yes. But I did not love only him; and while the comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does not want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built. And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one’s happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant—it is not fit—it is not possible that it should be so. Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her.	13	451	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4373	If such is your way of thinking, if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension.	14	451	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4374	I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told me,—it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph. This person’s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I have suffered now. The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. Then, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even what I owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that I was very unhappy.	15	451	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4392	Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.	1	453	76	whispered	immediately	f	f	f	f
4375	Oh! Elinor, you have made me hate myself for ever.—How barbarous have I been to you!—you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering for me!—Is this my gratitude?—Is this the only return I can make you?—Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying to do it away.	17	451	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4376	You have heard, I suppose, of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday.	1	452	67	said	with great solemnity	f	f	f	f
4377	Your sister has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars too—in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress—but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!—meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much confidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to be so rewarded! ‘I wish, with all my heart,’ says poor Fanny in her affectionate way, ‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’	3	452	67	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4378	What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected any prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in that quarter. ‘There, to be sure,’ said she, ‘I might have thought myself safe.’ She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny’s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.	5	452	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4379	Gracious God! can this be possible!	6	452	71	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4572	How then would you account for his behaviour?	9	469	70	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
4381	All this, however, was urged in vain. Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would stand to it, cost him what it might.	9	452	67	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4382	Then, he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good husband.	10	452	76	cried	with blunt sincerity	f	f	f	f
4383	I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours, madam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman, but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible. And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle’s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars’s conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one.	12	452	67	replied	without any resentment	f	f	f	f
4384	Well, sir, and how did it end?	14	452	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4385	I am sorry to say, ma’am, in a most unhappy rupture:—Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother’s notice. He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know; for we of course can make no inquiry.	15	452	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4386	Poor young man!—and what is to become of him?	16	452	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4387	What, indeed, ma’am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds—how can a man live on it?—and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our power to assist him.	17	452	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4388	Poor young man!, I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I could see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns.	18	452	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4389	If he would only have done as well by himself, as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it is, it must be out of anybody’s power to assist him. And there is one thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all—his mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle that estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward’s, on proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over the business.	20	452	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4390	Well!, that is her revenge. Everybody has a way of their own. But I don’t think mine would be, to make one son independent, because another had plagued me.	21	452	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4391	Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.	23	452	67	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4395	Not at all, I believe, with you.	5	453	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4398	I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are as good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night. There now, you are going to laugh at me too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it is the Doctor’s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never have known he did like it better than any other colour, if he had not happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.	8	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4399	Well, but Miss Dashwood, people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars’s declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set it down for certain.	10	453	83	speaking	triumphantly	f	f	f	f
4400	I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you.	11	453	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4401	Oh, did not you? But it was said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother’s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother’s house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for her sake, and upon her account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that—Oh, la! one can’t repeat such kind of things you know)—she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.	12	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4402	I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them; you were all in the same room together, were not you?	13	453	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4403	No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love when any body else is by? Oh, for shame!—To be sure you must know better than that.—No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door.	14	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4404	How!; have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?	15	453	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4405	Oh, la! there is nothing in that. I only stood at the door, and heard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.	16	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4406	Edward talks of going to Oxford soon; but now he is lodging at No.—, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is, an’t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I shan’t say anything against them to you; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however, nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a time; and after that, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good gracious! I’d lay my life I know what my cousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I know they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world. ‘La!’ I shall say directly, ‘I wonder how you could think of such a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!’	18	453	83	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4408	Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton won’t ask us any more this bout. Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!—I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.	21	453	83	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4409	Wait for his having a living!—ay, we all know how that will end:—they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord help ’em! how poor they will be! I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed! as I talked of t’ other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works. Betty’s sister would never do for them now.	1	454	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4410	Very well indeed!—how prettily she writes!—aye, that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor soul! I wish I could get him a living, with all my heart. She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived. Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned. Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to think of every body!—Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy’s head and heart great credit.	1	455	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4411	Cleveland! No, I cannot go to Cleveland.	1	456	71	cried	with great agitation	f	f	f	f
4412	You forget that its situation is not—that it is not in the neighbourhood of—	2	456	70	said	gently	f	f	f	f
4413	But it is in Somersetshire.—I cannot go into Somersetshire.—There, where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.	3	456	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4414	Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods; for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be, when I come back!—Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats.	1	457	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4415	I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.	1	458	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4416	I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.	2	459	70	say	with a voice which showed her to feel what she said	f	f	f	f
4417	I have heard of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have I been rightly informed? Is it so?;	5	459	74	said	with great compassion	f	f	f	f
4470	Mrs. Ferrars knows nothing about it at present, and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.	13	463	67	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4487	Miss Dashwood, for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to stay.	1	466	73	saying	in a voice rather of command than supplication	f	f	f	f
4418	The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty, of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing—what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day’s post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance; but that, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than 200£ per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very great. Pray assure him of it.	7	459	74	replied	with great feeling	f	f	f	f
4419	The smallness of the house, I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and income.	9	459	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4420	This little rectory can do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must still be a distant good; at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.	11	459	74	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4421	Well, Miss Dashwood, I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I tried to keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.	1	460	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4422	Thank you, ma’am. It is a matter of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.	2	460	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4423	Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an’t the least astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more likely to happen.	3	460	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4424	You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel’s general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur.	4	460	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4425	Opportunity!—Oh! as to that, when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I shall soon know where to look for them.	5	460	76	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4426	You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose.	6	460	70	said	with a faint smile	f	f	f	f
4427	Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as ever I saw.	7	460	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4430	Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out. But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be quite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to tell your sister all about it.	11	460	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4431	Certainly, ma’am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else.	13	460	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4432	Oh! very well. Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day.	14	460	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4433	No, ma’am, not even Lucy if you please. One day’s delay will not be very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do that directly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination.	15	460	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4434	Oh, ho!—I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel write himself?—sure, he is the proper person.	17	460	76	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
4435	Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.	19	460	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4436	And so you are forced to do it. Well that is an odd kind of delicacy! However, I will not disturb you. You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.	20	460	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4437	I have just been thinking of Betty’s sister, my dear. I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a lady’s maid, I am sure I can’t tell. She is an excellent housemaid, and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that at your leisure.	22	460	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4438	Certainly, ma’am.	23	460	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4439	Mrs. Jennings told me that you wished to speak with me, at least I understood her so—or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister; especially as it will most likely be some time—it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to Oxford tomorrow.	1	461	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4440	You would not have gone, however, without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on the point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most agreeable office. Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the living—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable, and such as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself—such, in short, as might establish all your views of happiness.	2	461	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4441	Colonel Brandon!	4	461	72	said	only	f	f	f	f
4442	Yes, Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed—for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you—a concern which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.	5	461	70	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4443	Colonel Brandon give me a living!—Can it be possible?	6	461	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4444	The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where.	7	461	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4445	No, not to find it in you; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.—I feel it—I would express it if I could—but, as you well know, I am no orator.	8	461	72	replied	with sudden consciousness	f	f	f	f
4446	You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon’s discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps—indeed I know he has, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe nothing to my solicitation.	9	461	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4447	Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.	11	461	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4448	Indeed, I believe that you will find him, on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he should be all this.	12	461	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4449	Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street.	14	461	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4450	I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you; to assure him that he has made me a very—an exceedingly happy man.	16	461	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4451	Well, my dear, I sent you up the young man. Did not I do right?—And I suppose you had no great difficulty—You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal?	1	462	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4452	No, ma’am; that was not very likely.	2	462	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4453	Well, and how soon will he be ready?—For it seems all to depend upon that.	3	462	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4454	Really, I know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination.	4	462	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4455	Two or three months!; Lord! my dear, how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord bless me!—I am sure it would put me quite out of patience!—And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already.	5	462	76	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4456	My dear ma’am, what can you be thinking of? Why, Colonel Brandon’s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.	6	462	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4573	I would suppose him,—Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle, very, very fickle.	10	469	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4458	Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one, and very likely may be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.	9	462	76	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4459	But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living’s being enough to allow them to marry.	10	462	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4460	The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan’t go if Lucy an’t there.	11	462	76	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4461	Fanny is in her own room, I suppose: I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you. Very far from it, indeed. Now especially there cannot be—but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites. Why would not Marianne come?	1	463	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4462	I am not sorry to see you alone, for I have a good deal to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon’s—can it be true?—has he really given it to Edward?—I heard it yesterday by chance, and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.	3	463	67	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4463	It is perfectly true.—Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward.	4	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4464	Really!—Well, this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection between them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the value of this?	5	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4465	About two hundred a year.	6	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4467	It is truly astonishing!—what could be the Colonel’s motive?	9	463	67	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4468	A very simple one—to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.	10	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4469	Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky man.—You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,—she will not like to hear it much talked of.	11	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4608	Did you see them off, before you came away?	19	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4471	But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon, for that must be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she supposed to feel at all? She has done with her son,—she cast him off for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account: she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!	14	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4472	Ah! Elinor, your reasoning is very good, but it is founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward’s unhappy match takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.	15	463	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4473	You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time.	16	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4474	You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world.	17	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4475	We think now—of Robert’s marrying Miss Morton.	19	463	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4476	The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.	21	463	70	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
4477	Choice!—how do you mean?	22	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4479	Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other.	24	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4480	Of one thing, my dear sister, I may assure you;—and I will do it, because I know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think—indeed I have it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it,—but I have it from the very best authority,—not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself—but her daughter did, and I have it from her,—that in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain connection, you understand me,—it would have been far preferable to her,—it would not have given her half the vexation that this does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. ‘It would have been beyond comparison,’ she said, ‘the least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse.’ But however, all that is quite out of the question,—not to be thought of or mentioned—as to any attachment you know, it never could be: all that is gone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well,—quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?	26	463	67	speaking	in an awful whisper	f	f	f	f
4478	I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.	23	463	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4466	Very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that value—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon—he might have got I dare say—fourteen hundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person’s death? Now, indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon’s sense! I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern! Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character. I suppose, however—on recollection—that the case may probably be this. Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.	7	463	67	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4508	It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject.	30	466	70	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4574	I am not wishing him too much good when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own. He will suffer enough in them.	12	469	71	said	with a sigh	f	f	f	f
4575	Do you compare your conduct with his?	13	469	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4481	We may treat it as a joke; but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it; for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from your slight acquaintance. Poor Edward! His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. But we are not all born, you know, with the same powers,—the same address. Poor fellow! to see him in a circle of strangers! To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe it. My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her, ‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him again.’ That was what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for himself completely,—shut himself out for ever from all decent society! But, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be expected. My poor mother was half frantic.	1	464	86	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4482	Have you ever seen the lady?	2	464	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4483	Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from the match; but it was too late then, I found, to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think it is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. ‘My dear fellow,’ I should have said, ‘consider what you are doing. You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.’ I cannot help thinking, in short, that means might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be starved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.	3	464	86	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4484	Is mama coming?	1	465	71	cried	out	f	f	f	f
4485	Not yet, but she will be here, I hope, before it is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.	2	465	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4486	But she must not go round by London. I shall never see her, if she goes by London.	3	465	71	cried	in the same hurried manner	f	f	f	f
4488	No, sir, I shall not stay. Your business cannot be with me. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.	2	466	70	replied	with firmness	f	f	f	f
4489	Had they told me that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the door. My business is with you, and only you.	3	466	73	cried	with vehemence	f	f	f	f
4490	With me! well, sir,—be quick—and if you can—less violent.	4	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4491	Sit down, and I will be both.	5	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4492	Pray be quick, sir,—I have no time to spare.	7	466	70	said	impatiently	f	f	f	f
4493	Your sister—is out of danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!—But is it true? is it really true?	9	466	73	said	with abruptness	f	f	f	f
4494	For God’s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?	11	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4495	We hope she is.	12	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4496	Had I known as much half an hour ago;—but since I am here—what does it signify? For once, Miss Dashwood—it will be the last time, perhaps—let us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood for gaiety. Tell me honestly” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks, “do you think me most a knave or a fool?	14	466	73	speaking	with a forced vivacity	f	f	f	f
4497	Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe. I am not at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.	16	466	70	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4498	I understand you; yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.	17	466	73	replied	with an expressive smile, and a voice perfectly calm	f	f	f	f
4499	At Marlborough!	18	466	70	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4500	Yes,—I left London this morning at eight o’clock, and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.	19	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4501	Mr. Willoughby, you ought to feel, and I certainly do, that after what has passed, your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that you mean by it?	21	466	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4502	I mean, if I can, to make you hate me one degree less than you do now. I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma— from your sister.	22	466	73	said	with serious energy	f	f	f	f
4503	Is this the real reason of your coming?	23	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4504	Upon my soul it is.	24	466	73	answer	with a warmth	f	f	f	f
4505	If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne does, she has long forgiven you.	25	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4506	Has she? Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable grounds. Now will you listen to me?	26	466	73	cried	in the same eager tone	f	f	f	f
4507	I do not know how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,—it is worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before. Your sister’s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a kind—it is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what she was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design of returning her affection.	28	466	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4679	Going to leave you?	2	485	92	repeat	\N	f	f	f	f
4509	I insist on you hearing the whole of it, My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself. Every year since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much,—I was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not then know what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a blessing.	31	466	73	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4510	You did then believe yourself at one time attached to her?	32	466	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4523	All!—no:—have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter? Did she show it you?	47	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4525	When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is—in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any emotion—my feelings were very, very painful.—Every line, every word was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here, would forbid—a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town was—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what a reproof would she have given me!—her taste, her opinions—I believe they are better known to me than my own,—and I am sure they are dearer.	49	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4526	This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.—Remember that you are married. Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.	51	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4539	Yes, you have certainly removed something—a little. You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly know—the misery that you have inflicted—I hardly know what could have made it worse.	65	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4511	To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness! Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even then, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here—nor will I stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the interim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a circumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,—Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not explain myself farther,” he added, looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,—“your particular intimacy—you have probably heard the whole story long ago.	33	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4512	I have, I have heard it all. And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension.	34	466	70	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
4513	Remember from whom you received the account. Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, she must be a saint. If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding—I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I wish—I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me (may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind—Oh! how infinitely superior!	35	466	73	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4514	Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl—I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours. You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.	36	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4515	But, upon my soul, I did not know it; I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to find it out.	37	466	73	replied	warmly	f	f	f	f
4516	Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?	38	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4534	Yes, yes, that in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,—and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia’s eye before it caught mine—and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents. She was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched. Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion—her malice—At all events it must be appeased. And, in short—what do you think of my wife’s style of letter-writing?—delicate—tender—truly feminine—was it not?	60	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4688	Indeed!	2	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4517	She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world—every thing was against me. The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not be—and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The night following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle was great—but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;—I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable—and left her hoping never to see her again.	39	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4518	Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?; a note would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to call?	40	466	70	said	reproachfully	f	f	f	f
4519	It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself—and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone. You were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately—I never shall forget it—united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!—Oh, God!—what a hard-hearted rascal I was!	41	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4520	Did you tell her that you should soon return?	43	466	70	spoke	first	f	f	f	f
4521	I do not know what I told her; less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it.—It won’t do.—Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it did torture me. I was miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent. My journey to town—travelling with my own horses, and therefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so cheerful—when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!—oh, it was a blessed journey!	44	466	73	replied	impatiently	f	f	f	f
4522	Well, sir, and this is all?	46	466	70	sad	\N	f	f	f	f
4524	Yes, I saw every note that passed.	48	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4527	Marianne’s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days,—that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever,—awakened all my remorse. I say awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, ‘I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.’ But this note made me know myself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat was impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;—but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely out of the house one morning, and left my name.	52	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4528	Watched us out of the house!	53	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4529	Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings’s. He asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning brought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate, open, artless, confiding—everything that could make my conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried—but could not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you can pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was then. With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking all that was—Well, it does not signify; it is over now. Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne’s sweet face as white as death. That was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same look and hue.	54	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4530	Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better, certainly out of danger?	56	466	73	broke	\N	f	f	f	f
4531	We are assured of it.	57	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4532	Your poor mother, too!—doting on Marianne.	58	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4533	But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to say about that?	59	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4536	Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own—her own happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do!—we were engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed—But I am talking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance. ‘I am ruined for ever in their opinion,’ said I to myself: ‘I am shut out for ever from their society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one.’ Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife’s words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three notes,—unluckily they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever,—I was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair—that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,—the dear lock,—all, every memento was torn from me.	62	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4537	You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable; you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not forced on you. Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have married you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne—nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.	63	466	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4538	Do not talk to me of my wife; she does not deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we married. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood? Or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,—be it only one degree,—am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before? My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any part of my guilt?	64	466	73	said	with a heavy sigh	f	f	f	f
4581	Tell mama.	22	469	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4609	No, ma’am—the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.	20	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4612	When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma’am?	1	472	70	inquiry	\N	f	f	f	f
4540	Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been telling you?—Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my penitence—tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.	66	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4541	I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness.	67	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4542	Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and when he saw who I was, for the first time these two months, he spoke to me. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to, though probably he did not think it would, vex me horridly. As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland—a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent—the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments—for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed? One person I was sure would represent me as capable of anything—What I felt was dreadful! My resolution was soon made, and at eight o’clock this morning I was in my carriage. Now you know all.	68	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f

4544	Are you going back to town?	71	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4545	No—to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a day or two. Good bye.	72	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4546	And you do think something better of me than you did?	74	466	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4547	As to that, I must rub through the world as well as I can. Domestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means—it may put me on my guard—at least, it may be something to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again—	76	466	73	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4548	Well—once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event.	78	466	73	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4549	What do you mean?	79	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4550	Your sister’s marriage.	80	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4551	You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is now.	81	466	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4552	But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear—but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by showing that where I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,—God bless you!	82	466	73	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4553	At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself.	1	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4554	You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon’s marrying one of you as the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two.	3	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4576	No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with yours.	14	469	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4577	Our situations have borne little resemblance.	15	469	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4592	I have not a doubt of it; and I have nothing to regret—nothing but my own folly.	12	470	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4644	Where shall the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?	1	479	89	inquiry	calm	f	f	f	f
4555	He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;—he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing her.	5	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4556	His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant—which ever we are to call it—has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne’s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!—and without selfishness—without encouraging a hope!—could he have seen her happy with another—Such a noble mind!—such openness, such sincerity!—no one can be deceived in him.	7	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4557	Colonel Brandon’s character, as an excellent man, is well established.	8	467	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4558	I know it is, or after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.	9	467	69	replied	seriously	f	f	f	f
4559	His character, however, does not rest on one act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What answer did you give him?—Did you allow him to hope?	10	467	70	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
4560	Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself. Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or encouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet after a time I did say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every encouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will do everything; Marianne’s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it.	11	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4561	To judge from the Colonel’s spirits, however, you have not yet made him equally sanguine.	12	467	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4604	Do you know where they came from?	13	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4610	Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?	21	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4562	No. He thinks Marianne’s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There, however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed; and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby; but at the same time, there is something much more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a something, if you remember, in Willoughby’s eyes at times, which I did not like.	13	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4563	And his manners, the Colonel’s manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby’s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness, often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with Colonel Brandon.	15	467	69	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4564	At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me, even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,—for I hear it is a large village,—indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our present situation.	17	467	69	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4565	His fortune too!—for at my time of life you know, everybody cares about that;—and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be a good one.	19	467	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4566	When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength, we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John’s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.	1	468	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4567	There, exactly there—on that projecting mound,—there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.	1	469	71	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
4568	I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot! shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor? Or will it be wrong? I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to do.	3	469	71	said	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
4569	As for regret—I have done with that, as far as he is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him, but what they are now. At present, if I could be satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not always acting a part, not always deceiving me; but above all, if I could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl—	5	469	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4570	If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.	7	469	70	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
4571	Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has been what he has been to me, of such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to—	8	469	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4578	They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,—wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I have lived in your remembrance! My mother too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.	16	469	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4605	They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy—Mrs. Ferrars told me.	14	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4611	Yes, ma’am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady—and she seemed vastly contented.	22	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4613	I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to hear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.	2	472	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4579	You are very good.—The future must be my proof. I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it—my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby—to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment.	18	469	71	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4580	If I could but know his heart, everything would become easy.	19	469	71	added	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
4582	I wish to assure you both that I see every thing—as you can desire me to do.	1	470	71	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4583	It is a great relief to me—what Elinor told me this morning—I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear.	3	470	71	continued	slowly	f	f	f	f
4584	I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must have known, all this.—I should have had no confidence, no esteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.	4	470	71	added	with greater calmness than before	f	f	f	f
4585	I know it—I know it. Happy with a man of libertine practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!—Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt.	5	470	69	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4586	I wish for no change.	6	470	71	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4587	You consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before. Your sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage? Beyond that, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge his enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties?	7	470	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4588	Selfish?	8	470	71	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4589	The whole of his behaviour, from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.	9	470	70	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4590	It is very true. My happiness never was his object.	10	470	71	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4591	At present, he regrets what he has done. And why does he regret it?—Because he finds it has not answered towards himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now unembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?—The inconveniences would have been different. He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always necessitous—always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.	11	470	70	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4593	Rather say your mother’s imprudence, my child; she must be answerable.	13	470	69	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4594	One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the story—that all Willoughby’s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.	15	470	70	continued	immediately	f	f	f	f
4595	I suppose you know, ma’am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.	1	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4596	Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?	4	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4597	I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma’am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you, ma’am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars’s, their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back, they’d make sure to come and see you.	5	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4598	But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?	6	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4599	Yes, ma’am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy.	7	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4600	Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?	8	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4601	Yes, ma’am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look up;—he never was a gentleman much for talking.	9	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4602	Was there no one else in the carriage?	11	471	69	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4603	No, ma’am, only they two.	12	471	87	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4615	At Longstaple! No, my mother is in town.	2	473	72	replied	with an air of surprise	f	f	f	f
4616	I meant to enquire for Mrs. Edward Ferrars.	3	473	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4617	Perhaps you mean—my brother—you mean Mrs.—Mrs. Robert Ferrars.	5	473	72	said	after some hesitation	f	f	f	f
4618	Mrs. Robert Ferrars!	6	473	71	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4619	Mrs. Robert Ferrars!	6	473	69	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4620	Perhaps you do not know: you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to—to the youngest—to Miss Lucy Steele.	7	473	72	said	in a hurried voice	f	f	f	f
4621	Yes, they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.	9	473	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4622	It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side, the consequence of ignorance of the world, and want of employment. Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too—at least I thought so then; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.	1	474	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4623	That was exactly like Robert.	1	475	72	observation	immediate	f	f	f	f
4624	And that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs might afterward arise.	2	475	72	added	presently	f	f	f	f
4625	I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition.—For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days.—In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!—how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!—and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish—business—this is the only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style.	12	475	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4626	However it may have come about—they are certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert’s marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.	13	475	70	said	after a pause	f	f	f	f
4627	She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.—She will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner.	14	475	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4628	I thought it my duty, independent of my feelings, to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.	17	475	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4639	What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action.	1	478	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4629	No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour; that your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her to marry you than be single.	18	475	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4630	Your behaviour was certainly very wrong; because—to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what, as you were then situated, could never be.	21	475	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4631	I was simple enough to think, that because my faith was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I was wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than these:—The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself.	23	475	72	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4632	Which, at present, after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.	25	475	72	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4634	A letter of proper submission!; would they have me beg my mother’s pardon for Robert’s ingratitude to her, and breach of honour to me? I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would not interest. I know of no submission that is proper for me to make.	1	476	72	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4635	You may certainly ask to be forgiven, because you have offended;—and I should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother’s anger.	2	476	70	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4636	And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first.	4	476	70	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4637	And if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit.	5	476	71	said	in her new character of candour	f	f	f	f
4638	I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister, that would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,—I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen; for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody else,—and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance: you understand me.	1	477	67	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4640	I think we cannot do better; let us send for the child.	2	478	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4641	My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one’s own hands; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just—but you know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of yours, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable establishment. You are thinking of your sons—but do not you know that, of all things upon earth, that is the least likely to happen, brought up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than a sister.	4	478	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4642	There is a great deal of truth in what you say, and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each. I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to ourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting.	5	478	90	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4643	I thoroughly understand you, you are everything that is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a sister’s child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, I will engage to get the child to Mansfield; you shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never regard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler’s, and the child be appointed to meet her there. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman’s wife or other going up.	6	478	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4645	Then she had better come to us.	2	479	89	said	with the utmost composure	f	f	f	f
4646	Yes, let her home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and of a regular instructress.	3	479	90	added	with dignity	f	f	f	f
4648	I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl, and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.	6	479	88	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4647	Very true, which are both very important considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach, or only two—there can be no difference. I only wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best place for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else.	4	479	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4649	Should her disposition be really bad, we must not, for our own children’s sake, continue her in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for her associates. Had my daughters been younger than herself, I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for them, and everything to hope for her, from the association.	7	479	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4650	That is exactly what I think, and what I was saying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the child, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would learn to be good and clever from them.	8	479	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4651	I hope she will not tease my poor pug; I have but just got Julia to leave it alone.	9	479	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4652	There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris, as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make her remember that she is not a Miss Bertram. I should wish to see them very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will always be different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct.	10	479	90	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
4653	This is not a very promising beginning. After all that I said to her as we came along, I thought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper—her poor mother had a good deal; but we must make allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it was her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.	1	480	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4654	My dear little cousin, what can be the matter?	1	481	91	said	with all the gentleness of an excellent nature	f	f	f	f
4656	You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny, which shows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you happy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters.	3	481	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4657	William did not like she should come away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed.	4	481	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4659	Yes, he had promised he would, but he had told her to write first.	6	481	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4661	she did not know; she had not any paper.	8	481	92	answered	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
4662	If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and every other material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Would it make you happy to write to William?	9	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4664	Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.	11	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4666	Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and, as your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.	13	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4668	Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to frank.	15	481	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4669	Dear mama, only think, my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together—or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia—or, she never heard of Asia Minor—or she does not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!—How strange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid?	1	482	93	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4670	My dear, it is very bad, but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself.	2	482	88	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
4671	But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!—Do you know, we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, she should cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight, and she calls it the Island, as if there were no other island in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!	3	482	93	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4672	Yes; and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals, semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.	4	482	93	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4673	Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already, there is a great deal more for you to learn.	5	482	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4674	Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing.	6	482	93	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4675	To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great want of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should be a difference.	7	482	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4676	she could only say it was very unlucky, but some people were stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know what else was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.	1	483	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4677	I blush for you, Tom; I blush for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income which ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I hope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts.	1	484	90	said	in his most dignified manner	f	f	f	f
4678	So, Fanny, you are going to leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?	1	485	89	observed	calmly	f	f	f	f
4680	Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years with us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died. But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.	3	485	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4681	I shall be very sorry to go away.	5	485	92	said	with a faltering voice	f	f	f	f
4682	Yes, I dare say you will; that’s natural enough. I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world.	6	485	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4683	I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt.	7	485	92	said	modestly	f	f	f	f
4684	No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.	8	485	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4685	And am I never to live here again?	9	485	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4686	Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other.	10	485	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4687	Cousin, something is going to happen which I do not like at all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.	1	486	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4689	Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as she is removed there.	3	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4690	Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call it an excellent one.	4	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4692	It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere. You will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you very much, Fanny?	6	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4693	Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in it: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with her.	7	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4694	I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the same with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to children. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you must be important to her.	8	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4695	I can never be important to any one.	9	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4696	What is to prevent you?	10	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4697	Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.	11	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4698	As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly. There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion.	12	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4699	You are too kind; how shall I ever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I am to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life.	13	486	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4700	Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the year. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. Here there are too many whom you can hide behind; but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself.	14	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4701	Oh! do not say so.	15	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4702	I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers.	16	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4703	I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody. Here, I know, I am of none, and yet I love the place so well.	17	486	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4704	The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house. You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride.	18	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4705	Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how much I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle’s opening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince me that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you proved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.	19	486	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4706	And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for your ultimate happiness too.	20	486	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4707	I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes to live with you.	2	487	89	observed	carelessly	f	f	f	f
4708	Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do you mean?	3	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4709	Is she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas.	4	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4825	And very ungrateful, I think.	6	493	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4710	Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to me. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what could I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at her time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need most attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is too much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would propose it. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?	5	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4711	Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.	6	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4712	But what did he say? He could not say he wished me to take Fanny. I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.	7	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4785	I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance, Fanny.	20	492	91	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
5224	Oh! they’ll tell you all about it.	6	531	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5320	She will be late; but what is your difficulty?	5	541	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5565	Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?	21	569	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5764	Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses myself.	22	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5830	You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is early.	19	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5833	Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?	25	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6156	But was not she a very low woman?	123	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4713	No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We both thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it, there is no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.	8	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4714	Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any comfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed—what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She is in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can.	9	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4715	Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?	10	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4716	Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done, but I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I have been a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income. A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the parish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House, matters must be better looked after. I must live within my income, or I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.	11	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4717	I dare say you will. You always do, don’t you?	12	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4718	My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me. It is for your children’s good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody else to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having.	13	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4719	You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are sure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.	14	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4720	Why, you know, Sir Thomas’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns.	15	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4721	Oh! that will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it, I know.	16	487	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4722	Well, Lady Bertram, I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question; besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must keep a spare room for a friend.	17	487	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4723	This was so thoughtful and kind!	1	488	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4724	If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though, I fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten.	2	488	90	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
4725	And now, I have thought of something to make it complete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice, handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy.	1	489	94	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4726	My dear sister, if you can persuade him into anything of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English abilities can do has been tried already. I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is inconceivable! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them avoid Henry.	3	489	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4727	My dear brother, I will not believe this of you.	4	489	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4728	No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious temper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet—‘Heaven’s last best gift.’	5	489	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4729	There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look at his smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral’s lessons have quite spoiled him.	6	489	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4730	I pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.	7	489	94	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4731	Oh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage.	9	489	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4732	I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister; they are very elegant, agreeable girls.	1	490	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4734	Oh yes! I like Julia best.	3	490	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4736	So I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and I prefer her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall always like Julia best, because you order me.	5	490	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4738	Do not I tell you that I like her best at first?	7	490	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4740	Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.	9	490	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4741	Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it is a great match for her.	10	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4739	And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother. Her choice is made.	8	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4737	I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you will like her best at last.	6	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4735	But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest.	4	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4733	So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you like Julia best.	2	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4786	I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place as it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.	21	492	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5301	Oh!	36	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4742	But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; that is your opinion of your intimate friend. I do not subscribe to it. I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it in her eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.	11	490	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4743	Mary, how shall we manage him?	12	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4744	We must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He will be taken in at last.	13	490	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4745	But I would not have him taken in; I would not have him duped; I would have it all fair and honourable.	14	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4746	Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just as well. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.	15	490	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4747	Not always in marriage, dear Mary.	16	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4748	In marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be so, when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect most from others, and are least honest themselves.	17	490	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4749	Ah! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.	18	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4750	My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but, however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business. I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a take in?	19	490	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4751	My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your pardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but half. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere—and those evil-minded observers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves.	20	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4752	Well done, sister! I honour your esprit du corps. When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in general would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.	21	490	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4753	You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both. Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us, and we will cure you.	22	490	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4754	I begin now to understand you all, except Miss Price. Pray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at the Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being out; and yet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she is.	1	491	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4755	I believe I know what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My cousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and not outs are beyond me.	2	491	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4756	And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl’s being out or not. A girl not out has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite—to confidence! That is the faulty part of the present system. One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing—and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. Mr. Bertram, I dare say you have sometimes met with such changes.	3	491	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4758	No, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am quite in the dark. But I will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me what about.	5	491	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4757	I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson.	4	491	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4776	The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam. The soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering.	9	492	100	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4777	Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost us—that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill—and I know it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.	10	492	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4778	You were imposed on, ma’am: these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It is an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which none from my garden are.	11	492	100	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4759	Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed on. You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an altered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly so. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the other day, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson. The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. When Anderson first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was not out, and I could not get her to speak to me. I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and a little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away, and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady—nothing like a civil answer—she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an air! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then out. I met her at Mrs. Holford’s, and did not recollect her. She came up to me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has heard the story.	6	491	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4760	And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say, than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set people right, but I do see that they are often wrong.	7	491	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4761	Those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right.	8	491	98	said	gallantly	f	f	f	f
4762	The error is plain enough; such girls are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards.	9	491	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4763	I do not know. Yes, I cannot agree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the business. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen done. That is worse than anything—quite disgusting!	10	491	95	replied	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
4764	Yes, that is very inconvenient indeed. It leads one astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what is expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September, just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd—you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund—his father, and mother, and sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out; we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made myself as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both well-dressed, with veils and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest, who was not out, and had most excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never forgiven me.	11	491	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4765	That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger sister, I feel for her. To be neglected before one’s time must be very vexatious; but it was entirely the mother’s fault. Miss Augusta should have been with her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper. But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls? Does she dine out every where, as well as at my sister’s?	12	491	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4766	No; I do not think she has ever been to a ball. My mother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant, and Fanny stays at home with her.	13	491	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4767	Oh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.	14	491	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4768	I wish you could see Compton; it is the most complete thing! I never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not know where I was. The approach now, is one of the finest things in the country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare, when I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison—quite a dismal old prison.	1	492	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4769	Oh, for shame! A prison indeed? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world.	2	492	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4770	It wants improvement, ma’am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it.	3	492	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4771	No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present; but depend upon it, Sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire.	4	492	94	said	with a smile	f	f	f	f
4772	I must try to do something with it, but I do not know what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.	5	492	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4773	Your best friend upon such an occasion would be Mr. Repton, I imagine.	6	492	97	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
4774	That is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, I think I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.	7	492	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4775	Well, and if they were ten, I am sure you need not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you, I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in the best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space to work upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part, if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, I should be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessively fond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting. We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it. You young ones do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more would have been done, but for poor Mr. Norris’s sad state of health. He could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and that disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had not been for that, we should have carried on the garden wall, and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has done. We were always doing something as it was. It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris’s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree, and getting to such perfection, sir.	8	492	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4779	The truth is, ma’am, that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it is so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a remarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves, my cook contrives to get them all.	12	492	94	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4780	Smith’s place is the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.	14	492	99	began	again	f	f	f	f
4781	Mr. Rushworth, if I were you, I would have a very pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather.	15	492	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4782	Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so much could be done at Compton, we need not despair. There have been two or three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and it opens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or anybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down: the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill, you know.	16	492	99	say	\N	f	f	f	f
4783	The avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of Sotherton.	17	492	97	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
4784	Cut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper? ‘Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.’	19	492	92	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
4787	Have you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out of distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.	22	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4788	Oh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it has been altered.	23	492	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4789	I collect that Sotherton is an old place, and a place of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?	24	492	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4790	The house was built in Elizabeth’s time, and is a large, regular, brick building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It is ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress, and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.	25	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4791	I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth; but, had I a place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an improver. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own choice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his.	27	492	91	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4793	It would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all.	29	492	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4794	Ay, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; and the only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favourite in the world, has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle, bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being excessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for three months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to step on, or a bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic seats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. Henry is different; he loves to be doing.	30	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4792	You would know what you were about, of course; but that would not suit me. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are before me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as much beauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till it was complete.	28	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4795	Mr. Bertram, I have tidings of my harp at last. I am assured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been these ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary.	32	492	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4796	The truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant, we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but this morning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher’s son-in-law left word at the shop.	33	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4797	I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope there will be no further delay.	34	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4798	I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed? Not by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.	35	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4799	You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?	36	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4800	I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to speak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet without seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible thing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers, all the hay in the parish! As for Dr. Grant’s bailiff, I believe I had better keep out of his way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at.	37	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4801	You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but when you do think of it, you must see the importance of getting in the grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.	38	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4802	I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the true London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs. However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is good-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it not be honourably conveyed?	39	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4823	Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was quite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!	4	493	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4824	I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.	5	493	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4803	I shall be most happy to play to you both; at least as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it. And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse will lose.	41	492	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4804	If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present, foresee any occasion for writing.	42	492	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4909	If Edmund were but in orders!: My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that you are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.	21	503	101	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4915	Query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great promise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?	30	503	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4917	This is insufferably hot. Shall any of us object to being comfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it. What happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like.	1	504	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4920	Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son.	4	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4922	But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought that was always the lot of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.	6	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4952	I shall soon be rested; to sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.	37	504	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4805	No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but one style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything as usual. Yours sincerely.’ That is the true manly style; that is a complete brother’s letter.	43	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4806	When they are at a distance from all their family, they can write long letters.	44	492	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4807	Miss Price has a brother at sea, whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us.	45	492	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4808	At sea, has she? In the king’s service, of course?	46	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4809	Do you know anything of my cousin’s captain?; Captain Marshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?	48	492	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4811	Among admirals, large enough; but, we know very little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort of men, but they do not belong to us. Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my home at my uncle’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears and Vices I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun, I entreat.	49	492	95	\N	with an air of grandeur	f	f	f	f
4812	It is a noble profession.	50	492	91	replied	only	f	f	f	f
4813	Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it is not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable form to me.	51	492	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4814	My dear Henry, have you nothing to say? You have been an improver yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place in England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham, as it used to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of ground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again!	54	492	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4815	Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it; but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere nothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for improvement, there was very little for me to do—too little: I should like to have been busy much longer.	55	492	96	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
4816	You are fond of the sort of thing?	56	492	101	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4817	Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done, and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid at Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at one-and-twenty executed. I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him. I have been a devourer of my own.	57	492	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4818	Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly. You can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.	58	492	101	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4819	There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford’s willingness; but why should not more of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford’s opinion on the spot, and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions; and, for my own part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the rest of you walked about and settled things, and then we could all return to a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight. I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at home with you.	60	492	88	interposed	\N	f	f	f	f
4820	Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford now? How did you like her yesterday?	1	493	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4821	Very well—very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at her.	2	493	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4822	It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play of feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you, Fanny, as not quite right?	3	493	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4826	Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt’s memory which misleads her here. She is awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not censure her opinions; but there certainly is impropriety in making them public.	7	493	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4827	Do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral.	8	493	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4828	That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do her good. Mrs. Grant’s manners are just what they ought to be. She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection.	9	493	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4912	If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect.	25	503	95	replied	only	f	f	f	f
5006	Yes.	6	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4829	Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William would never have used me so, under any circumstances. And what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent?	10	493	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4830	The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or loud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we have been speaking of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw it all as I did.	11	493	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4831	My dear Miss Price, I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven, you know, because there is no hope of a cure.	1	494	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4832	For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes, and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then. I wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.	2	494	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4833	No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you; I am very strong. Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear, delightful, beautiful animal.	3	494	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4834	It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding! I never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to have a thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began, six years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on!	5	494	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4835	I was sure she would ride well; she has the make for it. Her figure is as neat as her brother’s.	1	495	101	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4836	Yes, and her spirits are as good, and she has the same energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind.	2	495	97	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4837	No, I do not know—not if you want the mare.	1	496	92	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
4838	I do not want her at all for myself; but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time—for a whole morning, in short. She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you. It would be very wrong if she did. She rides only for pleasure; you for health.	2	496	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4839	I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly; I have been out very often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong enough now to walk very well.	3	496	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4840	But where is Fanny? Is she gone to bed?	1	497	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4841	No, not that I know of; she was here a moment ago.	2	497	88	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4842	That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as we do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week, not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.	4	497	88	scolding	\N	f	f	f	f
4843	I must say, ma’am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house.	5	497	101	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
4844	Fanny, I am sure you have the headache.	6	497	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4845	I can hardly believe you; I know your looks too well. How long have you had it?	8	497	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4846	Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.	9	497	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4847	Did you go out in the heat?	10	497	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4848	Go out! to be sure she did: would you have her stay within such a fine day as this? Were not we all out? Even your mother was out to-day for above an hour.	11	497	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4849	Yes, indeed, Edmund; I was out above an hour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again.	12	497	89	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4850	Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?	13	497	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4851	Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! She found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not wait.	14	497	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4944	But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw directly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in length.	28	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4852	There was no help for it, certainly; but I question whether her headache might not be caught then, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have mine filled.	15	497	88	rejoined	in a rather softened voice	f	f	f	f
4853	She has got it; she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time.	16	497	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4854	What!; has she been walking as well as cutting roses; walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am? No wonder her head aches.	17	497	91	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4855	I was afraid it would be too much for her; but when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then you know they must be taken home.	19	497	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4856	But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?	20	497	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4857	No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she was obliged to go again.	21	497	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4858	And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma’am, it has been a very ill-managed business.	22	497	91	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4913	For if we are too long going over the house, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It is past two, and we are to dine at five.	27	503	99	said	with the sort of self-evident proposition	f	f	f	f
4918	So you are to be a clergyman, Mr. Bertram. This is rather a surprise to me.	2	504	95	began with	\N	f	f	f	f
4859	I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better; unless I had gone myself, indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother’s dairymaid, by her desire, and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son, and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I cannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny’s just stepping down to my house for me—it is not much above a quarter of a mile—I cannot think I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?	23	497	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4860	I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma’am.	24	497	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4861	If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be knocked up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this long while, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to walk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her. But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot. Between ourselves, Edmund, it was cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the mischief.	25	497	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4862	I am afraid it was, indeed; I am very much afraid she caught the headache there, for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bear myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from the flower-beds, was almost too much for me.	26	497	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4863	The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that could give her a wish to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She will have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer for his being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback, you know.	1	498	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4864	The loss of her ladyship’s company would be a great drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and it was a pity she should not see the place.	2	498	102	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4865	You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam; but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is quite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.	3	498	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4866	Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.	4	498	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4867	But why is it necessary that Crawford’s carriage, or his only, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother’s chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day, understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family.	1	499	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4868	What!: go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather, when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not quite do.	2	499	101	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4869	Besides, I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us. After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.	3	499	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4870	And, my dear Edmund, taking out two carriages when one will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas, when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.	4	499	88	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4871	That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s; but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and does not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.	5	499	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4872	There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant, in going on the barouche box.	6	499	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4873	Unpleasant!: oh dear! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one’s view of the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box herself.	7	499	97	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4874	There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can be no doubt of your having room for her.	8	499	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4875	Fanny!; my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her going with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She is not expected.	9	499	88	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
4876	You can have no reason, I imagine, madam, for wishing Fanny not to be of the party, but as it relates to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you would not wish to keep her at home?	10	499	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4878	You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.	12	499	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4877	To be sure not, but I cannot do without her.	11	499	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6164	Can you really?	151	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4879	Yes, there is no necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not often a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma’am, you would be glad to give her the pleasure now?	13	499	91	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
4880	Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.	14	499	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4881	Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.	15	499	88	say	only	f	f	f	f
4882	It seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny.	16	499	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4883	I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you.	17	499	101	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4884	Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires.	18	499	91	reply	only	f	f	f	f
4885	Here is a fine burst of country. I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever so much;	1	500	101	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4914	Suppose we turn down here for the present. Here are the greatest number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.	29	503	102	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4916	James, I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet.	31	503	102	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4919	Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some profession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a soldier, nor a sailor.	3	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4921	A very praiseworthy practice, but not quite universal. I am one of the exceptions, and being one, must do something for myself.	5	504	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4923	Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?	7	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4886	Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties are over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village. Those cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses, built by some of the family. To the right is the steward’s house; he is a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, at this end; there is some fine timber, but the situation of the house is dreadful. We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an ill-looking place if it had a better approach.	1	501	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4887	it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect	2	501	92	observing	\N	f	f	f	f
4888	Now, where is the avenue? The house fronts the east, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front.	3	501	92	added	\N	f	f	f	f
4889	Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see something of it here—something of the more distant trees. It is oak entirely.	4	501	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4890	To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.	1	502	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4891	Now, we are coming to the chapel, which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but as we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will excuse me.	1	503	102	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4892	I am disappointed. This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be ‘blown by the night wind of heaven.’ No signs that a ‘Scottish monarch sleeps below.’	2	503	92	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
4893	You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have been buried, I suppose, in the parish church. There you must look for the banners and the achievements.	3	503	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4894	It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.	4	503	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4895	This chapel was fitted up as you see it, in James the Second’s time. Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.	5	503	102	began	\N	f	f	f	f
4896	Every generation has its improvements.	6	503	95	said	with a smile	f	f	f	f
4897	It is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one’s ideas of what such a household should be! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!	8	503	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4898	Very fine indeed. It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.	9	503	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4899	That is hardly Fanny’s idea of a family assembling. If the master and mistress do not attend themselves, there must be more harm than good in the custom.	10	503	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4900	At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects. Everybody likes to go their own way—to chuse their own time and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality, the restraint, the length of time—altogether it is a formidable thing, and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed, they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets—starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full of something very different—especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at—and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now.	11	503	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4943	Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken such a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path.	27	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4901	Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch, and human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a habit from neglect, what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a closet?	12	503	91	say	\N	f	f	f	f
4902	Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour. There would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would not be tried so long.	13	503	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4903	The mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the other, I believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service, however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are.	14	503	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4904	Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely the air of it?	15	503	101	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4905	I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar.	16	503	96	said	in a voice which she only could hear	f	f	f	f
4906	If he would give her away?	17	503	97	asked	in a tone not much louder	f	f	f	f
4907	I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly.	18	503	96	reply	with a look of meaning	f	f	f	f
4908	Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place directly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether, and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.	20	503	101	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4910	Ordained?; what, are you to be a clergyman?	23	503	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4911	Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father’s return—probably at Christmas.	24	503	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4924	Never is a black word. But yes, in the never of conversation, which means not very often, I do think it. For what is to be done in the church? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman is nothing.	8	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4925	The nothing of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as the never. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He must not head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners which result from their influence. No one here can call the office nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.	9	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4926	You assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see much of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair’s to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.	10	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4927	You are speaking of London, I am speaking of the nation at large.	11	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4928	The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.	12	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4929	Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character, and observing his general conduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the largest part only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The manners I speak of might rather be called conduct, perhaps, the result of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation.	13	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4931	There, you have quite convinced Miss Price already.	15	504	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4932	I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.	16	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4933	I do not think you ever will; I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change your mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.	17	504	95	said	with an arch smile	f	f	f	f
4934	Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness.	18	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4935	Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.	19	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4936	You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.	20	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4937	I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while.	21	504	92	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
4938	My dear Fanny, how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm.	22	504	91	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4939	Thank you, but I am not at all tired.	23	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4940	You scarcely touch me. You do not make me of any use. What a difference in the weight of a woman’s arm from that of a man! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.	24	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4941	I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?	25	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4942	Not half a mile.	26	504	91	answer	sturdy	f	f	f	f
4945	Oh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak within compass.	29	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4946	We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here. Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?	30	504	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4947	Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.	31	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4948	I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny; why would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.	33	504	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4949	How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen again.	34	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4950	Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect. Fanny’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.	35	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4951	That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there is nothing in the course of one’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to another, straining one’s eyes and one’s attention, hearing what one does not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found it so, though she did not know it.	36	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4953	I must move; resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view, without being able to see it so well.	38	504	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4954	Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up the walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile.	39	504	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4955	It is an immense distance; I see that with a glance.	40	504	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4956	Poor dear Fanny, how ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid with us.	1	505	97	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4957	It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from the house already.	4	505	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4958	Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected?	5	505	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4959	No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the truth, I do not think that I shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will hardly improve it to me.	6	505	96	speaking	rather lower	f	f	f	f
4960	You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people think Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.	7	505	97	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4961	I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world.	8	505	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4962	You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to see you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.	9	505	97	began	again	f	f	f	f
4963	Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle’s. Your sister loves to laugh.	10	505	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4964	You think her more light-hearted than I am?	11	505	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4965	More easily amused; consequently, you know, better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles’ drive.	12	505	96	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
4966	Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to think of now.	13	505	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4967	You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too fair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before you.	14	505	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4968	Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes, certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship. ‘I cannot get out,’ as the starling said.	15	505	97	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
4969	Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key!	16	505	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4970	And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth’s authority and protection, or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance; I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.	17	505	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4971	Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will. Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of sight.	18	505	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4972	Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.	19	505	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4973	You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram; you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better not go.	20	505	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
4974	Thank you, my dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.	21	505	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4975	Heyday! Where are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.	1	506	99	cried out	\N	f	f	f	f
4976	A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere. But they cannot be very far off, and I think I am equal to as much as Maria, even without help.	3	506	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4977	But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do wait for Mr. Rushworth.	4	506	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4978	Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why, child, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.	5	506	101	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4979	Yes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death, and could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all were.	7	506	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4980	It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.	8	506	101	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5258	Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I only wish you would talk to him more. You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle.	9	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4981	That is Miss Maria’s concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for her sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I can get away from.	9	506	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4982	They desired me to stay—my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.	1	507	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4983	I do not believe I shall go any farther; I see nothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else. I have had walking enough.	2	507	99	said	sullenly	f	f	f	f
4984	I am very sorry; it is very unlucky.	4	507	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4985	I think they might as well have staid for me.	5	507	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4986	Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.	6	507	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4987	I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.	7	507	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4988	Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.	8	507	99	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
4989	I do not think him at all handsome.	9	507	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5106	Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.	12	518	98	began	again	f	f	f	f
5315	I do not know. We will ask him. But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.	10	540	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5321	So strange! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.	6	541	89	add	\N	f	f	f	f
5407	I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets made but me.	5	551	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5566	I—I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.	22	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4990	Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is not five foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight. I think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these Crawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.	10	507	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4991	If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have been some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.	12	507	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4992	Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems like five.	13	507	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4993	wished he had had the key about him at the time.	14	507	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
4994	It is a pity you should not join them. They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know, can be settled without you.	15	507	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4995	Well, if you really think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing.	16	507	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4996	I hope I am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat.	1	508	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4997	Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word. Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day’s amusement you have had!	1	509	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
4998	I think you have done pretty well yourself, ma’am. Your lap seems full of good things, and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully.	2	509	97	say	directly	f	f	f	f
4999	My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as long as I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well.	3	509	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5000	What else have you been spunging?	4	509	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5001	Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants’ eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not take a denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and so to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some.	5	509	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5002	How happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is thinking of November.	1	510	95	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5003	Your father’s return will be a very interesting event.	3	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5004	It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but including so many dangers.	4	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5005	It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your sister’s marriage, and your taking orders.	5	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5007	Don’t be affronted, but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.	7	510	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5008	There is no sacrifice in the case; it is entirely her own doing.	8	510	91	replied	with a serious smile	f	f	f	f
5009	Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.	9	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5010	My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria’s marrying.	10	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5011	It is fortunate that your inclination and your father’s convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts.	11	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5012	Which you suppose has biassed me?	12	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5013	But that I am sure it has not.	13	510	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5031	There goes good-humour, I am sure. There goes a temper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she is asked. What a pity,” he added, after an instant’s reflection, “that she should have been in such hands!	31	510	91	said	presently	f	f	f	f
5014	Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly.	14	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5015	It is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.	15	510	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5017	But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected, you think? To be justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision.	17	510	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5016	No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors.	16	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5018	What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed; absolute madness.	18	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5019	Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his.	19	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5162	Come in.	1	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5020	Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish—read the newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work, and the business of his own life is to dine.	20	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5021	There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure, you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle’s table.	21	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5022	I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct. Though I have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information.	22	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5023	Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad, they were always wishing away.	23	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5024	Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp.	24	510	92	apostrophe	tender	f	f	f	f
5025	I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that I can hardly suppose—and since you push me so hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, I see him to be an indolent, selfish bon vivant, who must have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it.	25	510	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5026	I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to defend Dr. Grant.	26	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5027	No, but we need not give up his profession for all that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have taken a—not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where he would have had less time and obligation—where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the frequency, at least, of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man—a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the better for it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman.	27	510	92	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5028	We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.	28	510	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5029	I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons.	29	510	91	said	affectionately	f	f	f	f
5030	I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it.	30	510	95	say	in a pleasant manner	f	f	f	f
5080	I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it.	11	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5032	Here’s harmony!; here’s repose! Here’s what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can attempt to describe! Here’s what may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene.	32	510	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5033	I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life. They lose a great deal.	33	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5034	You taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.	34	510	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5035	I had a very apt scholar. There’s Arcturus looking very bright.	35	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5036	Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.	36	510	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5037	We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?	37	510	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5038	Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing.	38	510	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5039	Yes; I do not know how it has happened. We will stay till this is finished, Fanny.	39	510	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5040	I am rather surprised that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here so long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about, that I thought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield.	1	511	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5041	It is to his credit; and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.	2	511	91	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5042	What a favourite he is with my cousins!	3	511	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5574	Yes, sir.	31	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5043	Yes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I believe, suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much symptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove.	4	511	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5044	If Miss Bertram were not engaged, I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.	5	511	92	said	cautiously	f	f	f	f
5045	Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.	6	511	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5046	I think, ma’am, we shall see some happy faces again now.	1	512	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5047	Yes, ma’am, indeed, there will be some satisfaction in looking on now, and I think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my son did not propose it.	2	512	102	replied	with a stately simper	f	f	f	f
5048	I dare say he did, ma’am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth—that wish of avoiding particularity! Dear ma’am, only look at her face at this moment; how different from what it was the two last dances!	3	512	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5049	It is quite delightful, ma’am, to see young people so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I cannot but think of dear Sir Thomas’s delight. And what do you say, ma’am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example, and such things are very catching.	5	512	88	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5050	The couple above, ma’am. Do you see no symptoms there?	7	512	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5051	Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match. What is his property?	8	512	102	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5052	Four thousand a year.	9	512	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5053	Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very genteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.	10	512	102	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5054	It is not a settled thing, ma’am, yet. We only speak of it among friends. But I have very little doubt it will be. He is growing extremely particular in his attentions.	11	512	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5055	If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.	1	513	98	said	in a languid way	f	f	f	f
5056	I am glad of it, for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long. They had need be all in love, to find any amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers—all but Yates and Mrs. Grant—and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor. A strange business this in America, Dr. Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters.	2	513	98	said	in a much brisker tone	f	f	f	f
5057	My dear Tom, as you are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall you?” Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal, added in a whisper, “We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you know. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will just do; and though we play but half-crowns, you know, you may bet half-guineas with him.	3	513	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5058	I should be most happy, it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am this moment going to dance. Come, Fanny, do not be dawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.	4	513	98	replied	aloud	f	f	f	f
5059	A pretty modest request upon my word. To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours with herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too! without ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility of refusing. That is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my spleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of being given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is a great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head, nothing can stop her.	6	513	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5259	But I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hear me ask him about the slave-trade last night?	10	536	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5060	A trifling part, and not at all to my taste, and such a one as I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make no difficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for him that he should have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more equal to the Baron—a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the piece materially; but I was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. And upon the whole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.	1	514	103	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5061	It was a hard case, upon my word.	2	514	104	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5062	I do think you were very much to be pitied.	3	514	104	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5063	It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all happening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great harm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.	4	514	103	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5064	An afterpiece instead of a comedy. Lovers’ Vows were at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort him; and perhaps, between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make you amends, Yates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our manager.	5	514	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5163	Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?	2	521	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5316	Sir Thomas, stop a moment—I have something to say to you.	1	541	89	called	\N	f	f	f	f
5065	I really believe I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language. Let us be doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what should prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure; and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We shall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.	6	514	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5066	We must have a curtain; a few yards of green baize for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.	7	514	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5067	Oh, quite enough, with only just a side wing or two run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more.	8	514	103	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5068	I believe we must be satisfied with less. There would not be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford’s views, and make the performance, not the theatre, our object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.	9	514	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5069	Nay. Let us do nothing by halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from beginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a song between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.	10	514	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5070	Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable. Nobody loves a play better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.	11	514	101	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5071	True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.	12	514	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5072	Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not to be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I think, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one good thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre, precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther end, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five minutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father’s room, is the very thing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and my father’s room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the billiard-room on purpose.	1	515	98	began	\N	f	f	f	f
5073	You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?	2	515	91	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
5074	Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you in it?	3	515	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5075	I think it would be very wrong. In a general light, private theatricals are open to some objections, but as we are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling on my father’s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely delicate.	4	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5076	You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father’s return, and invite all the country. But it is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father’s being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks, I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he. It is a very anxious period for her.	5	515	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5077	By Jove! this won’t do. To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety—I was unlucky there.	8	515	98	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5078	What is the matter?; I was not asleep.	9	515	89	asked	in the heavy tone of one half-roused	f	f	f	f
5079	Oh dear, no, ma’am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund, but this I will maintain, that we shall be doing no harm.	10	515	98	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5081	And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a decided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to be’d and not to be’d, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am sure, my name was Norval, every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays.	12	515	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5082	It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never wish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is strict.	13	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5083	I know all that. I know my father as well as you do; and I’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I’ll take care of the rest of the family.	14	515	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5084	If you are resolved on acting, I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father’s house in his absence which could not be justified.	15	515	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5085	For everything of that nature I will be answerable. His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the breakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute nonsense!	16	515	98	said	in a decided tone	f	f	f	f
5086	The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an expense.	17	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5165	I want to consult. I want your opinion.	4	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5576	No, sir.	33	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5087	Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a little carpenter’s work, and that’s all; and as the carpenter’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed, everything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself. Don’t act yourself, if you do not like it, but don’t expect to govern everybody else.	18	515	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5088	No, as to acting myself, that I absolutely protest against.	19	515	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5089	Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them. Your brother’s taste and your sisters’ seem very different.	21	515	92	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5090	I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them, and that is all I can do.	22	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5091	I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.	23	515	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5092	I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself, I shall let things take their course, without attempting it through her. Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears.	24	515	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5093	No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want of understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.	1	516	96	calling out	\N	f	f	f	f
5094	This will never do. We are wasting time most abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that something is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many must not frighten us. We must double them. We must descend a little. If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of it. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse to give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more.	1	517	98	said	at last	f	f	f	f
5095	Lovers’ Vows! And why should not Lovers’ Vows do for us as well as for the Ravenshaws? How came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would do exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt.	3	517	98	exclaimed	suddenly	f	f	f	f
5096	This is not behaving well by the absent. Here are not women enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford.	1	518	101	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5097	It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her, as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.	2	518	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5098	I must entreat Miss Julia Bertram not to engage in the part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must not, indeed you must not. I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away.	4	518	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5099	Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha. Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it. There is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her features are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance. She had better do the old countrywoman: the Cottager’s wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager’s wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit. You shall be Cottager’s wife.	5	518	98	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5100	Cottager’s wife! What are you talking of? The most trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult to propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more justice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.	6	518	103	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5151	Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You’ll do it very well. Every allowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must get a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.	28	520	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5101	Why, as to that, my good friend, till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager’s wife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager’s speeches instead of Cottager’s wife’s, and so change the parts all through; he is solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play, and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife’s speeches, I would undertake him with all my heart.	7	518	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5102	With all your partiality for Cottager’s wife, it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we must not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not allow her to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance. Her talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession. It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. It requires a gentlewoman—a Julia Bertram. You will undertake it, I hope?	8	518	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5103	No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her. She would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and robust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and I am persuaded will do it admirably.	9	518	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5104	You must oblige us, indeed you must. When you have studied the character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you. You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your basket.	10	518	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5105	You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions—though one might have supposed—but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!	11	518	101	said	with hasty indignation and a tremulous voice	f	f	f	f
5166	My opinion!	5	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5107	Do not be afraid of my wanting the character: I am not to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert, unnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and this is comedy in its worst form.	13	518	101	cried	with angry quickness	f	f	f	f
5108	I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall probably do it very ill, I feel persuaded she would do it worse.	14	518	97	began	\N	f	f	f	f
5109	We have got a play. It is to be Lovers’ Vows; and I am to be Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.	1	519	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5110	Lovers’ Vows!	3	519	91	\N	in a tone of the greatest amazement	f	f	f	f
5111	Yes. After all our debatings and difficulties, we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so unexceptionable, as Lovers’ Vows. The wonder is that it should not have been thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to have anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.	4	519	103	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5112	But what do you do for women?	5	519	91	said	gravely	f	f	f	f
5113	I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and Miss Crawford is to be Amelia.	6	519	97	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
5114	I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up, with us.	7	519	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5115	I come in three times, and have two-and-forty speeches. That’s something, is not it? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak.	8	519	99	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5116	I cannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell you, that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I hope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary to send you to your father’s judgment, I am convinced.	9	519	91	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5117	We see things very differently. I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it; and I am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation.	10	519	97	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5118	I am sorry for it; but in this matter it is you who are to lead. You must set the example. If others have blundered, it is your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is. In all points of decorum your conduct must be law to the rest of the party.	11	519	91	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5119	I am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. There would be the greatest indecorum, I think.	12	519	97	answered	with far more good-humour	f	f	f	f
5120	Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your conduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and it will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your motive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it ought.	13	519	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5121	Do not act anything improper, my dear. Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.—To be sure, Julia is dressed by this time.	14	519	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5122	I am convinced, madam, that Sir Thomas would not like it.	15	519	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5123	There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?	16	519	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5124	If I were to decline the part, Julia would certainly take it.	17	519	97	said	with renewed zeal	f	f	f	f
5125	What!, if she knew your reasons!	18	519	91	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5152	You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me.	29	520	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5260	I did—and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.	11	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5126	Oh! she might think the difference between us—the difference in our situations—that she need not be so scrupulous as I might feel necessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we shall never act anything.	19	519	97	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5127	I was just going to say the very same thing. If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure that would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss of half a day’s work about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put them so very close together. I am of some use, I hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants’ hall-door with two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants’ dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought to be ashamed of himself), ‘I’ll take the boards to your father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.’ The boy looked very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while. I hate such greediness—so good as your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!	20	519	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5128	I must really congratulate your ladyship on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the same predicament.	1	520	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5179	Oh, cousin!	19	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5222	How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting.	4	531	89	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5317	I have something to tell you that will surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.	2	541	89	began	\N	f	f	f	f
5322	But is it not very natural that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?	7	541	91	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5129	My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?	2	520	95	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5130	Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.	3	520	104	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5131	I had my choice of the parts; but I thought I should like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am to have.	4	520	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5132	You chose very wisely, I am sure; Anhalt is a heavy part.	5	520	95	replied	with a brightened look	f	f	f	f
5133	The Count has two-and-forty speeches, which is no trifle.	6	520	99	returned	\N	f	f	f	f
5134	I am not at all surprised at this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men.	7	520	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5135	I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible; but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I will not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done—I will look it over again.	8	520	98	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5136	Your brother should take the part. Do not you think he would?	9	520	103	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
5137	I shall not ask him.	10	520	98	replied	in a cold, determined manner	f	f	f	f
5138	They do not want me at all. I only puzzle them, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as you do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and, therefore, I apply to you. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?	12	520	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5139	My advice is that you change the play.	13	520	91	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
5140	I should have no objection; for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if everything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table, it certainly will not be taken.	14	520	95	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5141	If any part could tempt you to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt; for he is a clergyman, you know.	16	520	89	observed	archly	f	f	f	f
5142	That circumstance would by no means tempt me, for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.	17	520	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5143	Fanny, we want your services.	19	520	98	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5144	Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your present services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be Cottager’s wife.	21	520	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5145	Me! Indeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give me the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.	22	520	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5146	Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten you: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen speeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you to look at.	23	520	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5147	If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches, what would you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.	24	520	99	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5148	It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart; but I really cannot act.	25	520	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5149	Yes, yes, you can act well enough for us. Learn your part, and we will teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall be Cottager, I’ll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very well, I’ll answer for it.	26	520	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5150	No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea. It would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I should only disappoint you.	27	520	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5261	I did—and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.	12	536	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5153	What a piece of work here is about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as they are to you! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat.	30	520	88	addressing	in a whisper at once angry and audible	f	f	f	f
5154	Do not urge her, madam. It is not fair to urge her in this manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for herself, as well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted. Do not urge her any more.	31	520	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5155	I am not going to urge her; but I shall think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her—very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is.	32	520	88	replied	sharply	f	f	f	f
5156	I do not like my situation: this place is too hot for me.	33	520	95	said	immediately, with some keenness	f	f	f	f
5157	Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and teasing, but do not let us mind them.	34	520	95	saying	in a kind, low whisper	f	f	f	f
5158	But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it. We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are one or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over to Stoke, and settle with one of them.	36	520	98	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5159	As far as I am concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister’s one day, did not he, Henry? A quiet-looking young man. I remember him. Let him be applied to, if you please, for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.	37	520	95	replied	calmly	f	f	f	f
5160	the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly	38	520	101	observed	in a sarcastic manner	f	f	f	f
5161	I am not very sanguine as to our play; and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of his speeches, and a great many of my own, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable, and by no means what I expected.	39	520	95	said	in an undervoice to Fanny	f	f	f	f
5164	Yes, certainly.	3	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5167	Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable, the more than intimacy—the familiarity. I cannot think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must, if possible, be prevented. Do not you see it in the same light?	6	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5168	Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.	7	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5169	There is but one thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself. I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.	8	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5170	It is not at all what I like. No man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency. After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now, when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?	10	521	91	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5171	No, not immediately, but—	11	521	92	said	slowly	f	f	f	f
5172	But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over. Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that may, of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man’s being received in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints. To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. It is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford’s place, Fanny. Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be felt for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations—perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be—it would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings ought to be respected. Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.	12	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5173	I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the others!	13	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5174	They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it. But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business, of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this be worth gaining?	14	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5175	Yes, it will be a great point.	15	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5176	But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?	16	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5177	No, I cannot think of anything else.	17	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5178	Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without it.	18	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5180	If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet—But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act—no matter whom: the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought you would have entered more into Miss Crawford’s feelings.	20	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5181	No doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her.	21	521	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5182	She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night. It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.	22	521	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5183	She was very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared	23	521	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5339	Yes, sir.	11	543	92	answer	humble	f	f	f	f
6226	It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.	38	686	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5184	I shall walk down immediately after breakfast, and am sure of giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has been full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly making it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity. You, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into China, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on? And here are Crabbe’s Tales, and the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.	25	521	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5185	Perhaps Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now. Perhaps you may persuade her.	1	522	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5186	No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.	2	522	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5187	Oh! very well.	3	522	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5188	I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry.	1	523	94	observation	\N	f	f	f	f
5189	I dare say she is. I imagine both sisters are.	2	523	95	replied	coldly	f	f	f	f
5190	Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think of Mr. Rushworth!	3	523	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5191	You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may do her some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth’s property and independence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. A man might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape a profession and represent the county.	4	523	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5192	I dare say he will be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I dare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet.	5	523	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5193	Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home. Do you remember Hawkins Browne’s ‘Address to Tobacco,’ in imitation of Pope?— Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.  I will parody them— Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.  Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas’s return.	6	523	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5221	Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.	3	531	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5194	You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him. He has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house, and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. I am sure Julia does not, or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.	15	523	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5195	I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed.	16	523	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5196	If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry, for a time.	17	523	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5197	Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this? For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion.	1	524	99	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5198	Come, Fanny, these are fine times for you, but you must not be always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth’s cloak without sending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice. It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do. You are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than you, we should not get on very fast.	1	525	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5199	One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny should be delighted: it is all new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, I mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play about, Fanny? you have never told me.	3	525	89	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5200	Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers’ Vows.	4	525	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5201	I believe there will be three acts rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once.	5	525	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5202	You had better stay till the curtain is hung; the curtain will be hung in a day or two—there is very little sense in a play without a curtain—and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons.	6	525	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5203	Am I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.	1	526	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5204	Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be so obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund—by ourselves—against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he were, I do not think I could go through it with him, till I have hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You will be so good, won’t you?	3	526	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5205	Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean? Here it is. I did not think much of it at first—but, upon my word. There, look at that speech, and that, and that. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things? Could you do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy you him, and get on by degrees. You have a look of his sometimes.	5	526	95	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5206	Have I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must read the part, for I can say very little of it.	6	526	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5239	We have all been more or less to blame, very one of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout; who has been consistent. Her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last. She never ceased to think of what was due to you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.	1	533	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5207	None of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for it. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage. There—very good school-room chairs, not made for a theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the dining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If they are not perfect, I shall be surprised. By the bye, I looked in upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with me. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as well as I could, by whispering to him, ‘We shall have an excellent Agatha; there is something so maternal in her manner, so completely maternal in her voice and countenance.’ Was not that well done of me? He brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy.	7	526	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5208	Dr. Grant is ill. He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it tough, sent away his plate, and has been suffering ever since	1	527	95	said	with mock solemnity	f	f	f	f
5209	If Miss Price would be so good as to read the part.	2	527	104	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5210	Do, Fanny, if it is not very disagreeable to you.	3	527	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5211	You have only to read the part.	5	527	96	said	with renewed entreaty	f	f	f	f
5212	And I do believe she can say every word of it, for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am sure you know the part.	6	527	97	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5213	My father is come! He is in the hall at this moment.	8	527	101	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5215	I need not be afraid of appearing before him.	1	528	101	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5216	Shall I go too? Had not I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?	2	528	99	question	repeated	f	f	f	f
5217	he preferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he was come; and besides, he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away.	1	529	103	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5218	But where is Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?	1	530	90	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5219	Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.	1	531	88	burst through	\N	f	f	f	f
5220	Still the same anxiety for everybody’s comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris. But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea.	2	531	90	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5223	Indeed! and what have you been acting?	5	531	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5225	The all will soon be told; but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rains almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd. Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire. I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were. I never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year. I hope you will take a day’s sport there yourself, sir, soon.	7	531	98	cried	hastily	f	f	f	f
5226	Something must be done.	9	531	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5227	It is time to think of our visitors. Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?	10	531	97	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5228	Then poor Yates is all alone. I will go and fetch him. He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out.	12	531	98	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5229	I come from your theatre; I found myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room—but in every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.	1	532	90	said	composedly	f	f	f	f
5230	This was, in fact, the origin of our acting. My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford, and it spread—as those things always spread, you know, sir—the faster, probably, from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.	2	532	98	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5231	To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going through the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Our company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour of your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeak your indulgence.	4	532	103	talking	\N	f	f	f	f
5232	My indulgence shall be given, sir, but without any other rehearsal.	5	532	90	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
5233	I come home to be happy and indulgent.	6	532	90	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5234	Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?	7	532	90	said	tranquilly	f	f	f	f
5235	Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant, lively girl.	8	532	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5236	I do not say he is not gentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man.	9	532	99	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5237	If I must say what I think, in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing.	11	532	99	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5238	I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do not feel, is perfectly natural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight.	12	532	90	replied	with an approving smile	f	f	f	f
5257	Oh! don’t talk so, don’t talk so.	8	536	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5240	If I had not been active, and made a point of being introduced to his mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did persuade her. You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.	1	534	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5241	I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children, and am the more concerned that it should not have been—	2	534	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5242	My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads that day! I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter—and this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; so I said, ‘Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.’ But, however, I soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for the horses. And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much, but it was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but that I did not regard. My object was accomplished in the visit.	3	534	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5243	I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth’s manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish.	4	534	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5318	Well.	3	541	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5244	Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him. He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities; and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it, for everybody considers it as my doing. ‘Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,’ said Mrs. Grant the other day, ‘if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.’	5	534	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5245	From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be; I will attend you from any place in England, at an hour’s notice.	1	535	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5246	I am sorry you are going; but as to our play, that is all over—entirely at an end. The painter was sent off yesterday, and very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how that would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody there.	2	535	98	say	with easy fluency	f	f	f	f
5247	It is about my uncle’s usual time.	3	535	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5248	When do you think of going?	4	535	98	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5249	I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.	5	535	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5250	Whose stables do you use at Bath?	6	535	98	question	\N	f	f	f	f
5251	But they have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seem to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away. I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is, that my father hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England. If he knew them better, he would value their society as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease. Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father.	1	536	91	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5252	Do you think so?: in my opinion, my uncle would not like any addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be—I mean before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always much the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; but I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when my uncle was in town. No young people’s are, I suppose, when those they look up to are at home	2	536	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5253	I believe you are right, Fanny. I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.	3	536	91	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
5254	I suppose I am graver than other people. The evenings do not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies. I could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains me more than many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I dare say.	4	536	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5255	Why should you dare say that? Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet? But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go to my father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy you. Ask your uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.	5	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5256	Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny—and that is the long and the short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something more of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never did admire you till now—and now he does. Your complexion is so improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure—nay, Fanny, do not turn away about it—it is but an uncle. If you cannot bear an uncle’s admiration, what is to become of you? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at. You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman.	7	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5262	Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day: that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those were her words. She has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishes characters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable! She certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long; and with regard to some others, I can perceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions of the moment, that she could define many as accurately, did not delicacy forbid it. I wonder what she thinks of my father! She must admire him as a fine-looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners; but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve may be a little repulsive. Could they be much together, I feel sure of their liking each other. He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers. I wish they met more frequently! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side.	13	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5263	She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension. And Sir Thomas’s wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so very natural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little while, I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing for the difference of the time of year.	14	536	92	said	with half a sigh	f	f	f	f
5264	This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and November is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.	15	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5265	To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr. Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth.	17	536	92	talk	\N	f	f	f	f
5266	That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow’s visit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread the stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to follow—the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much longer deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met.	18	536	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5267	Another quarter of an hour and we shall see how it will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those clouds look alarming.	1	537	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5268	But they are passed over. I have been watching them. This weather is all from the south.	2	537	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5269	South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play something more to you—a very pretty piece—and your cousin Edmund’s prime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin’s favourite.	3	537	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5270	This is pretty, very pretty; every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago, this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field, never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in another three years, we may be forgetting—almost forgetting what it was before. How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the changes of the human mind!	1	538	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5271	If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out.	2	538	92	added	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
5272	It may seem impertinent in me to praise, but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!	4	538	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5273	Yes, it does very well for a place of this sort. One does not think of extent here; and between ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.	5	538	95	replied	carelessly	f	f	f	f
5274	I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive! My uncle’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general. The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen! When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence. You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy.	6	538	92	said	in reply	f	f	f	f
5275	To say the truth, I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and, moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.	7	538	95	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5276	Too quiet for you, I believe.	8	538	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5277	I should have thought so theoretically myself, but, take it all and all, I never spent so happy a summer. But then, there is no saying what it may lead to.	9	538	95	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
5278	I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country, under certain circumstances, very pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family connexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even more than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a tête-à-tête with the person one feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing frightful in such a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as that.	11	538	95	went on	with renewed animation	f	f	f	f
5340	Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is upon Edmund’s account. I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.	12	543	88	spoken	in angry agitation	f	f	f	f
5341	Now I must look at you, Fanny, and tell you how I like you; and as well as I can judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?	1	544	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5279	Envy Mrs. Rushworth! Come, come, it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours. I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year. Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth’s wife must be to fill her house, and give the best balls in the country.	12	538	92	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5280	Ah! here he is. My sister and Mr. Bertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he may be Mr. Bertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. Edmund Bertram so formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.	13	538	95	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5281	How differently we feel! To me, the sound of Mr. Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or character! It just stands for a gentleman, and that’s all. But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections.	15	538	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5282	I grant you the name is good in itself, and Lord Edmund or Sir Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the annihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas. Well, shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year, by being up before they can begin?	16	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5283	Well, and do you not scold us for our imprudence? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?	18	538	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5284	Perhaps I might have scolded if either of you had been sitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a great deal.	19	538	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5285	They cannot have been sitting long, for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then they were walking.	20	538	94	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5319	Edmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?	4	541	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5765	What’s the name of your great cousins in town, Fan?	1	625	143	calling out	\N	f	f	f	f
5286	And really, the day is so mild, that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May.	21	538	91	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5287	Upon my word, you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no giving you a moment’s uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been suffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very little hope of him from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my own sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.	22	538	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5288	Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest chance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a different quarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time—for here are some of my plants which Robert will leave out because the nights are so mild, and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change of weather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody (at least Robert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse, cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me think the weather most unseasonably close.	23	538	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5289	The sweets of housekeeping in a country village! Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.	24	538	95	said	archly	f	f	f	f
5290	My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul’s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have me do?	25	538	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5291	Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often, and never lose your temper.	26	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5292	Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing forth bitter lamentations.	27	538	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5293	I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort. A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.	28	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5294	You intend to be very rich?	29	538	91	said	with a look which had a great deal of serious meaning	f	f	f	f
5295	To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?	30	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5296	I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command. Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth. She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of their coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.	31	538	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5297	By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your income, and all that. I understand you—and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent connexions. What can you want but a decent maintenance? You have not much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means—but I shall not envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich.	32	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5298	Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what I have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty is exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something between, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on.	33	538	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5299	But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction.	34	538	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5300	But how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction?	35	538	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5302	You ought to be in parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.	37	538	95	add	\N	f	f	f	f
5342	The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin’s marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.	2	544	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5303	That is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No, Miss Crawford, there are distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance—absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining—but they are of a different character.	38	538	91	added	in a more serious tone	f	f	f	f
5304	And you know what your dinner will be—the turkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear, cook insists upon the turkey’s being dressed to-morrow.	1	539	94	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5305	Very well, very well, all the better; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want to hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is all we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us.	2	539	100	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5306	But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny? How came she to think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this sort of way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go. Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?	1	540	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5307	If you put such a question to her, Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my dear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she should not.	2	540	91	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5308	I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She never did before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never asked Fanny.	3	540	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5309	If you cannot do without me, ma’am—	4	540	92	said	in a self-denying tone	f	f	f	f
5310	But my mother will have my father with her all the evening.	5	540	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5311	To be sure, so I shall.	6	540	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5312	Suppose you take my father’s opinion, ma’am.	7	540	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5313	That’s well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as soon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.	8	540	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5314	As you please, ma’am, on that head; but I meant my father’s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation’s being accepted or not; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by Fanny, that being the first invitation it should be accepted.	9	540	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5323	Nothing can be more natural; nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything, in my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant’s shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady Bertram’s niece, could never want explanation. The only surprise I can feel is, that this should be the first time of its being paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence.	8	541	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5324	But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?	9	541	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5325	Indeed I think you may.	10	541	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5326	She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.	11	541	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5327	Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us, and I shall certainly be at home.	12	541	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5328	Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.	13	541	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5329	Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle’s side. He had but one opinion. You are to go.	1	542	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5330	Thank you, I am so glad.	2	542	92	reply	instinctive	f	f	f	f
5331	Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to you; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come into her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia had been at home, you would not have been asked at all.	1	543	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5332	Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you would not be allowed to go. I shall be here, so you may be quite easy about your aunt. And I hope you will have a very agreeable day, and find it all mighty delightful. But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too, which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better it would have been! and how much more he would have been respected! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere. Remember that, Fanny. Five—only five to be sitting round that table. However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.	3	543	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5333	The nonsense and folly of people’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give you a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins—as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. That will never do, believe me. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to be taking place of her. And as to coming away at night, you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle that.	5	543	88	went on	again	f	f	f	f
5334	Yes, ma’am, I should not think of anything else.	6	543	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5335	And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I certainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will not be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what may happen, and take your things accordingly.	7	543	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5336	Fanny, at what time would you have the carriage come round?	8	543	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5337	My dear Sir Thomas!, Fanny can walk.	9	543	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5338	Walk! My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?	10	543	90	repeated	in a tone of most unanswerable dignity	f	f	f	f
5343	A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same?	3	544	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5344	Heyday!, here’s company, here’s a carriage! who have they got to meet us? Tis Crawford’s, Crawford’s barouche, I protest! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This is quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him.	5	544	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5345	So! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton, I understand; happy man!	1	545	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5346	Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they not? And Julia is with them.	3	545	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5347	And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.	4	545	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5348	Mr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates.	5	545	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5349	Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches! Nobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him now—his toil and his despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two-and-forty speeches to her; She is too good for him—much too good.	6	545	96	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5408	Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle says nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.	6	551	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5767	And don’t they live in Wimpole Street?	4	625	143	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5350	You were Mr. Rushworth’s best friend. Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part—in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied—to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own! He might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party.	7	545	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5351	It is as a dream, a pleasant dream! I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such an animation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all alive. There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour of the day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got over. I never was happier.	9	545	96	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5352	We were unlucky, Miss Price, we certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other week, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal of events—if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been a difference. Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather—but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I think, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week’s calm in the Atlantic at that season.	11	545	96	continued	in a lower tone	f	f	f	f
5353	As far as I am concerned, sir, I would not have delayed his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough.	12	545	92	said	with a firmer tone than usual	f	f	f	f
5354	I believe you are right. It was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy.	13	545	96	replied	in a calmer, graver tone	f	f	f	f
5355	Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss.	14	545	95	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5356	The most interesting in the world—how to make money; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I find he takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all for his menus plaisirs; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice.	15	545	96	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5357	Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look rather blank, Henry, if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year.	16	545	95	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5358	Perhaps I might; but all that you know is entirely comparative. Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet’s family. By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for it.	17	545	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5359	Bertram, I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not you join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time—as I shall do—not to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.	19	545	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5360	I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can; for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.	20	545	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5361	And how do you think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a plan for the intermediate days, and what do you think it is?	2	546	96	said	with a smile	f	f	f	f
5362	To walk and ride with me, to be sure.	3	546	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5363	Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but that would be exercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides, that would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.	4	546	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5364	Fanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins.	5	546	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5397	I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard me telling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant?	1	550	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5398	It is the only way, sir, in which I could not wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey. Edmund, am I saying too much?	2	550	90	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6250	Captain Wentworth, which way are you going? Only to Gay Street, or farther up the town?	7	688	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5365	But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small hole in Fanny Price’s heart. You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice. When we talked of her last night, you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks. You see her every day, and therefore do not notice it; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn. She was then merely a quiet, modest, not plain-looking girl, but she is now absolutely pretty. I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of hers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is decided beauty; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express. And then, her air, her manner, her tout ensemble, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches, at least, since October.	6	546	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5366	Phoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with, and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her so well dressed before. She is just what she was in October, believe me. The truth is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice, and you must have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty—not strikingly pretty—but ‘pretty enough,’ as people say; a sort of beauty that grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.	7	546	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5410	Yes, very; only I am soon tired.	9	551	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5768	Yes, sir.	5	625	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5831	I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday.	21	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5881	If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters.	57	643	149	began	\N	f	f	f	f
5367	I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do not understand her. I could not tell what she would be at yesterday. What is her character? Is she solemn? Is she queer? Is she prudish? Why did she draw back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her to speak. I never was so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to entertain her, and succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me! I must try to get the better of this. Her looks say, ‘I will not like you, I am determined not to like you’; and I say she shall.	8	546	96	said	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
5368	Foolish fellow! And so this is her attraction after all! This it is, her not caring about you, which gives her such a soft skin, and makes her so much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy; a little love, perhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge her deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a great deal of feeling.	9	546	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5369	It can be but for a fortnight; and if a fortnight can kill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I will not do her any harm, dear little soul! I only want her to look kindly on me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk to her; to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and pleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again. I want nothing more.	10	546	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5370	Moderation itself! I can have no scruples now. Well, you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together.	11	546	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5371	What shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse me most?	1	547	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5372	Very well; then speculation, if you please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach me.	3	547	89	answer	contented	f	f	f	f
5373	I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.	1	548	94	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5374	Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know what it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest.	4	548	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5375	Bertram, I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home. I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because I can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usual luck—for I never do wrong without gaining by it—I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right—which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman’s house to be seen excepting one—to be presumed the Parsonage—within a stone’s throw of the said knoll and church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.	1	549	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5376	It sounds like it; but which way did you turn after passing Sewell’s farm?	2	549	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5377	I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never be able to prove that it was not Thornton Lacey—for such it certainly was.	3	549	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5378	You inquired, then?	4	549	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5379	No, I never inquire. But I told a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.	5	549	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5380	You have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place.	6	549	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5381	Well, and how did you like what you saw?	8	549	91	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5382	Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable.	9	549	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5383	No, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you; but I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and when the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to it.	10	549	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5399	Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring.	4	550	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6251	I hardly know.	9	688	155	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5384	The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut out the blacksmith’s shop. The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north—the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be done. And there must be your approach, through what is at present the garden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to the south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yards up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look about me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows beyond what will be the garden, as well as what now is, sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of course; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Then the stream—something must be done with the stream; but I could not quite determine what. I had two or three ideas.	11	549	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5385	And I have two or three ideas also, and one of them is, that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I think the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air of a gentleman’s residence, without any very heavy expense, and that must suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.	12	549	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5386	There, I will stake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not born to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be from not striving for it.	13	549	95	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5406	Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William. It is not worth minding. It is no reflection on you; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that, you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor’s share, like bad weather and hard living, only with this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind.	4	551	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5411	I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you never any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I’d dance with you if you would, for nobody would know who I was here, and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about together many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street? I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better. Is not Fanny a very good dancer, sir?	10	551	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5387	My plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form it in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of. (Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie just before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman’s residence. That will be done by the removal of the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman’s residence, so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage-house—above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in. The air of a gentleman’s residence, therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is capable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody’s striking out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into a place. From being the mere gentleman’s residence, it becomes, by judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste, modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road; especially as there is no real squire’s house to dispute the point—a circumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation. You think with me, I hope. Have you ever seen the place?	15	549	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5388	No, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her too dearly, and your brother does not offer half her value. No, no, sir, hands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She is quite determined. The game will be yours,” turning to her again; “it will certainly be yours.	16	549	96	pursued	\N	f	f	f	f
5389	And Fanny had much rather it were William’s. Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes!	17	549	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5390	Mr. Bertram, you know Henry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help. Only think how useful he was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There we went, and there we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!	18	549	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5391	I cannot say there was much done at Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each other, and bewildered.	19	549	96	replied	laughingly	f	f	f	f
5392	I should be sorry to have my powers of planning judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see things very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.	20	549	96	added	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
5393	Sotherton! Yes, that is a place, indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth’s fine fortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly know the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins.	21	549	88	called out	in high good-humour	f	f	f	f
5394	I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head; and if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am.	22	549	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5395	I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own.	23	549	90	saying	with authority	f	f	f	f
5396	I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else.	24	549	105	answer	only	f	f	f	f
5450	One thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care how you talk to me. Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for. The time may come—	14	555	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5400	We shall be the losers. His going, though only eight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might ride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it will not. He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners, and prove himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he does very little either for their good or his own.	5	550	90	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5401	I repeat again that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should not be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier.	7	550	90	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5402	Sir Thomas undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest. We must hope his son may prove that he knows it too.	9	550	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5403	This is the assembly night. If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it, perhaps.	1	551	105	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5404	But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?	2	551	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5405	No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner. The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One is nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing fine girls, but they will hardly speak to me, because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant.	3	551	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5409	Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?	8	551	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5412	I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an opportunity of doing ere long.	11	551	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5413	I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price, and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction. But I believe it must be at some other time. There is one person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of.	12	551	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5414	Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see your aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear Sir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you, and Edmund and William.	15	551	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5415	I do not like, William, that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me pleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton. Your cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would not altogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would be more eligible; and if—	1	552	90	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5416	Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!, I knew what was coming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home, or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion for such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield. I know you would. If they were at home to grace the ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle, William, thank your uncle!	2	552	88	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
5417	My daughters have their pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.	3	552	90	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5418	that she was not at all afraid of the trouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.	6	552	89	assured	\N	f	f	f	f
5419	But what shall you have by way of necklace? Shall not you wear your brother’s cross?	1	553	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5420	You see what a collection I have; more by half than I ever use or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old necklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.	2	553	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5421	When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you, and feel how very kind you were.	3	553	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5422	You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace. You must think of Henry, for it was his choice in the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be a family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too.	4	553	95	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5423	My dear child, what are you afraid of? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a throat in the world? or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us, and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire?	5	553	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5424	Well, then, to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the necklace and say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother’s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it. He is always giving me something or other. I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half. And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty, but I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very one which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other. Say no more against it, I entreat you. Such a trifle is not worth half so many words.	7	553	95	replied	more seriously	f	f	f	f
5683	Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her, however, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must be prepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment. She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart.	16	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5684	I knew she would be very angry with me.	17	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5425	Fanny, I beg your pardon for being here. I came to look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will find the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle—a chain for William’s cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has been a delay from my brother’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected; and I have only just now received it at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.	1	554	91	said	directly	f	f	f	f
5426	Oh! cousin, stop a moment, pray stop!	2	554	92	called out	\N	f	f	f	f
5427	I cannot attempt to thank you; thanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can possibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond—	4	554	92	continued	in a very agitated manner	f	f	f	f
5428	If that is all you have to say, Fanny	5	554	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5429	No, no, it is not. I want to consult you.	6	554	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5430	Oh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the very thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They must and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable moment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.	7	554	92	bursting forth	again	f	f	f	f
5431	My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most happy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for to-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours. No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so unalloyed. It is without a drawback.	8	554	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5432	But what is it that you want to consult me about?	9	554	91	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5433	Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be mortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?	11	554	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5434	If it had been given to me in the first instance, I should not have thought of returning it; but being her brother’s present, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it, when it is not wanted?	12	554	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5435	She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its having been originally her brother’s gift makes no difference; for as she was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that account, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom.	13	554	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5436	No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace.	14	554	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5437	For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it be a sacrifice; I am sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford’s attentions to you have been—not more than you were justly entitled to—I am the last person to think that could be, but they have been invariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the meaning, is not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered with any reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is my advice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting principally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise, between the two dearest objects I have on earth.	15	554	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5438	Fanny. You look tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.	1	555	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5439	No, I have not been out at all.	2	555	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5440	Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had better have gone out.	3	555	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5441	I come from Dr. Grant’s. You may guess my errand there, Fanny.	5	555	91	said	presently	f	f	f	f
5442	I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances.	6	555	91	explanation	\N	f	f	f	f
5443	Yes, she is engaged to me; but he says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me. She is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she is not serious; but I would rather not hear it. She never has danced with a clergyman, she says, and she never will. For my own sake, I could wish there had been no ball just at—I mean not this very week, this very day; to-morrow I leave home.	7	555	91	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
5444	I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle meant it so.	8	555	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5445	Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. I am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny, you know what all this means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a kind, kind listener. I have been pained by her manner this morning, and cannot get the better of it. I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own, but the influence of her former companions makes her seem—gives to her conversation, to her professed opinions, sometimes a tinge of wrong. She does not think evil, but she speaks it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, it grieves me to the soul.	9	555	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5446	The effect of education.	10	555	92	said	gently	f	f	f	f
5447	Yes, that uncle and aunt! They have injured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does appear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.	11	555	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5448	If you only want me as a listener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified for an adviser. Do not ask advice of me. I am not competent.	12	555	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5449	You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need not be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few, I imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their conscience. I only want to talk to you.	13	555	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5451	Dearest Fanny!, you are all considerate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never come. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it most improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should, there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had. You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said; but you have always known my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny, that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked over her little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up every serious idea of her; but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever befell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude.	16	555	91	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5452	Yes, cousin, I am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some might not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do not check yourself. Tell me whatever you like.	17	555	92	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
5453	Yes, she looks very well. I sent Chapman to her.	1	556	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5454	Look well! Oh, yes!, she has good reason to look well with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has been, with all the benefit of her cousins’ manners before her. Only think, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her. The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married. What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand?	2	556	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5455	You must dance with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like, except the first.	3	556	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5456	Did he? Did Edmund? That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honour him beyond expression.	1	557	95	exclaimed	with eager pleasure	f	f	f	f
5457	Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford.	3	558	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5458	It must be so, my dear.	4	558	90	said	too decidedly	f	f	f	f
5459	Yes, she does look very well. Chapman helped her to dress. I sent Chapman to her.	1	559	89	reply	placid	f	f	f	f
5460	Ah! ma’am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!	2	559	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5471	Well, well!	8	561	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5784	Did you?	10	629	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5461	Perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The first time he ever denied me his confidence! But this is what we all come to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for information. Pray, what is Henry going for?	4	559	95	said	with a significant look	f	f	f	f
5462	Well, then, I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you by the way.	6	559	95	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5463	I am worn out with civility. I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. But with you, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be talked to. Let us have the luxury of silence.	1	560	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5464	Poor Fanny!, how soon she is knocked up! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these two hours. How can you be tired so soon?	1	561	105	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5465	So soon! my good friend; it is three o’clock, and your sister is not used to these sort of hours.	2	561	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5466	Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep as long as you can, and never mind me.	3	561	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5467	Oh! William.	4	561	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5469	Oh! yes, sir; I must get up and breakfast with him. It will be the last time, you know; the last morning.	6	561	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5470	You had better not. He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past nine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?	7	561	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5468	What! Did she think of being up before you set off?	5	561	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5472	Yes, half-past nine, and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sister to get up for me.	9	561	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5473	I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to-morrow.	10	561	96	\N	in a lower tone	f	f	f	f
5474	I cannot think what is the matter with me. I feel quite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must do something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel so very stupid.	1	562	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5475	We miss our two young men.	1	563	90	observation	\N	f	f	f	f
5476	And there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to Edmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be the last winter of his belonging to us, as he has done.	2	563	90	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5477	Yes, but I wish he was not going away. They are all going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.	3	563	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5478	Yes.	4	563	89	\N	calmly	f	f	f	f
5479	Sir Thomas, I have been thinking—and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.	5	563	89	observed	spontaneously	f	f	f	f
5480	Very true. We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face, she is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to her, she is now quite as necessary to us.	6	563	90	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
5481	Yes; and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her.	7	563	89	said	presently	f	f	f	f
5482	She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here.	8	563	90	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
5483	And that is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her.	9	563	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5484	And how do you like your cousin Edmund’s staying away so long? Being the only young person at home, I consider you as the greatest sufferer. You must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?	1	564	95	began	with a voice as well regulated as she could	f	f	f	f
5485	I do not know. Yes; I had not particularly expected it.	2	564	92	said	hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
5486	Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the general way all young men do.	3	564	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5487	He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.	4	564	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5488	He finds the house more agreeable now. He is a very—a very pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen him once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes; I think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price, in our language—a something between compliments and—and love—to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So many months’ acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here. Was his letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is doing? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?	5	564	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5489	I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed to do so. A few days longer, or some days longer; I am not quite sure which.	6	564	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5490	Oh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise. Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you, there would have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls and parties. He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody. How many Miss Owens are there?	7	564	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5491	Three grown up.	8	564	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5492	Are they musical?	9	564	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5493	I do not at all know. I never heard.	10	564	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5494	That is the first question, you know, which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies—about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family; it is a regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for not being taught; or something like it.	11	564	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5495	I know nothing of the Miss Owens.	12	564	92	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
5512	No.	12	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5800	Very true, very true. What Miss Anne says, is very true.	25	631	145	rejoinder	\N	f	f	f	f
5920	No!	33	648	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5496	You know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone express indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one has never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. She does not like my going.	13	564	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5497	You cannot doubt your being missed by many. You will be very much missed.	14	564	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5498	Oh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I am not fishing; don’t compliment me. If I am missed, it will appear. I may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.	15	564	95	said	laughingly	f	f	f	f
5499	The Miss Owens; suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it? Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishment for them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is everybody’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram’s son is somebody; and now he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman, and their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together. He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them. You don’t speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don’t speak. But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?	17	564	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5500	No; I do not expect it at all.	18	564	92	said	stoutly	f	f	f	f
5501	Not at all! I wonder at that. But I dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all—or not at present.	19	564	95	cried	with alacrity	f	f	f	f
5502	No, I do not.	20	564	92	said	softly	f	f	f	f
5503	He is best off as he is.	21	564	95	said	only	f	f	f	f
5504	My dear Henry, where can you have been all this time?	1	565	95	cried out	\N	f	f	f	f
5505	Sitting with them an hour and a half!	2	565	95	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5506	Yes, Mary: I could not get away sooner; Fanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely made up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price.	3	565	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5507	Yes, Mary. I am fairly caught. You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed.	6	565	96	assurance	concluding	f	f	f	f
5508	Lucky, lucky girl!; what a match for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my first feeling; but my second, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight of all the family, indeed! And she has some true friends in it! How they will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When did you begin to think seriously about her?	7	565	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5509	Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind.	8	565	95	interrupted	eagerly	f	f	f	f
5510	When Fanny is known to him, he will doat on her. She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral, for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world. She is the very impossibility he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely settled—settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my business yet.	10	565	96	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5532	I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother is a lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother’s promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.	1	566	96	said	with a most animated look	f	f	f	f
5511	Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That Mansfield should have done so much for—that you should have found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not want for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her own happiness?	11	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5513	What are you waiting for?	13	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5514	For—for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.	14	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5515	Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing—supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)—you would be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would marry you without love; that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.	15	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5516	I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her; and that is what I want.	17	565	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5517	The more I think of it, the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.	19	565	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5518	It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years’ lease of Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I could name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.	20	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5519	Ha!; settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we shall be all together.	21	565	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5520	You must give us more than half your time. I cannot admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!	23	565	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5521	You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?	25	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5801	Oh! certainly.	27	631	147	rejoinder	\N	f	f	f	f
5930	Do you mean that she refused him?	20	649	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5523	That’s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer with the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! You are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would have broken my heart.	27	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5524	Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must not prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one another.	28	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5525	Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman.	29	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5526	Had you seen her this morning, Mary, attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt’s stupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman’s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to me, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said. Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing.	31	565	96	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5527	My dearest Henry, how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?	32	565	95	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5528	I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense. I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be angry.	33	565	96	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5529	Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments’ ill flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women’s, though I was the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due. Now she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.	34	565	96	\N	in a cooler tone	f	f	f	f
5530	Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or forgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.	35	565	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5531	Edmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior, long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what do they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in the world, to what I shall do?	36	565	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5718	I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties he had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours; and there are so many young men’s claims to be attended to in the same way, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put by. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him.	28	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5533	I will not talk of my own happiness, great as it is, for I think only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment’s delay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your brother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend, as this day does prove it. Now I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together.	4	566	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5534	Has this been all your doing, then? Good heaven! how very, very kind! Have you really—was it by your desire? I beg your pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I am stupefied.	5	566	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5535	How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!	6	566	92	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5536	I will go to my uncle. My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible.	7	566	92	crying out	\N	f	f	f	f
5537	She must not go, she must allow him five minutes longer.	8	566	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5538	No, no, no! This is all nonsense. Do not distress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot bear, I must not listen to such—No, no, don’t think of me. But you are not thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.	9	566	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5802	The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.	29	631	146	remark	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
5931	Oh! yes; certainly.	22	649	157	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5539	Now William would be able to keep himself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some difference in her presents too. She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in her power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give him something rather considerable; that is, for her, with her limited means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin. She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many things to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it.	1	567	88	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5540	I am glad you gave him something considerable, for I gave him only £10.	2	567	89	said	with most unsuspicious calmness	f	f	f	f
5541	Indeed! Upon my word, he must have gone off with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey to London either!	3	567	88	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5542	Sir Thomas told me £10 would be enough.	4	567	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5543	It is amazing how much young people cost their friends, what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are my sister Price’s children; take them all together, I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing of what I do for them.	6	567	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5544	Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help it; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny, William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I will have two shawls, Fanny.	7	567	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5545	Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it be only a line.	1	568	96	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5546	Oh yes! certainly—I will write directly.	2	568	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5547	You cannot think I mean to hurry you, you cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.	10	568	96	said	in an undervoice	f	f	f	f
5548	Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a moment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give that to Miss Crawford.	11	568	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5549	Why have you no fire to-day?	1	569	90	said	with much surprise	f	f	f	f
5550	I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.	3	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5551	But you have a fire in general?	4	569	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5553	How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable. In your bedchamber I know you cannot have a fire. Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to sit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong. You are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.	6	569	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5554	my aunt Norris	7	569	92	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5581	Well, well, child, dry up your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good. You must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already. You must give him your own answer: we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which, unfortunately for himself, he certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it.	40	569	90	said	in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger	f	f	f	f
5582	Mr. Crawford is gone: he has just left me. I need not repeat what has passed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my representation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.	1	570	90	began with	\N	f	f	f	f
5555	I understand: I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate, and very judiciously, for young people’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on another account, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments have always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have been, and I believe has been, carried too far in your case. I am aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging partially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you will consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which seemed to be your lot. Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant; and of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I must speak to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long.	8	569	90	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5556	You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I had not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was shewn in. His errand you may probably conjecture.	10	569	90	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
5557	And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to. Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen, is yet in the house. He is in my room, and hoping to see you there.	12	569	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5558	Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to him. Mr. Crawford ought to know—he must know that: I told him enough yesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday, and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me, and quite out of my power to return his good opinion.	13	569	92	exclaim	\N	f	f	f	f
5559	I do not catch your meaning. Out of your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know he spoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so properly, and honourably—what are your scruples now?	14	569	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5560	You are mistaken, sir; you are quite mistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no encouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect my exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him, that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I said as much as that and more; and I should have said still more, if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be, I could not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended. I thought it might all pass for nothing with him.	15	569	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5561	Am I to understand that you mean to refuse Mr. Crawford?	17	569	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5567	This is very strange! There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything to recommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character, but with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation pleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing that for your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on. He has done it already.	23	569	90	said	in a voice of calm displeasure	f	f	f	f
5568	Yes.	24	569	92	said	in a faint voice	f	f	f	f
5569	You must have been aware, you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford’s manners to you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed his attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I have no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not quite know your own feelings.	25	569	90	continued	presently	f	f	f	f
5570	Oh yes, sir! indeed I do. His attentions were always—what I did not like.	26	569	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5571	This is beyond me. This requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen scarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections—	27	569	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5572	No, no, I know that is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there is nothing more to be said.	28	569	90	added	quickly	f	f	f	f
5573	Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford’s choice seemed to justify, his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an advocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and would have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon after four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge, matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were more likely to fix. Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than his brother. He, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? Do you agree with me, my dear?	30	569	90	said	very composedly	f	f	f	f
5575	Have you any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford’s temper?	32	569	90	said	in a voice of authority	f	f	f	f
5577	It is of no use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed. For I had, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence. But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to have had a moment’s share in your thoughts on this occasion. How they might be benefited, how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you, is nothing to you. You think only of yourself, and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a little more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his merits. Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth. And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect. You are not to be judged by the same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude—	35	569	90	said	with a good deal of cold sternness	f	f	f	f
5578	I am very sorry, I am very sorry indeed.	37	569	92	said	inarticulately	f	f	f	f
5579	Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day’s transactions.	38	569	90	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5580	If it were possible for me to do otherwise; but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy, and that I should be miserable myself.	39	569	92	said	with another strong effort	f	f	f	f
5721	That may be, sister. I dare say you are very right; but I am sure I shall miss her very much.	3	611	89	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
5583	Of course, it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural, a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed; perhaps to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears; they do but exhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to shew me any observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise you to go out: the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel; you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better for air and exercise. And, Fanny, I shall make no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment; say nothing about it yourself.	2	570	90	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5584	If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny, which I have since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry myself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.	1	571	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5585	I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place.	4	571	90	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5586	Oh!, that was very kind of you, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house. Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all her fault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she likes to go her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I would advise her to get the better of.	5	571	88	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5587	Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma’am, in his own room.	1	572	106	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5588	Stay, stay, Fanny! what are you about? where are you going? don’t be in such a hurry. Depend upon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me; but you are so very eager to put yourself forward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, you mean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir Thomas wants me, not Miss Price.	2	572	88	called out	\N	f	f	f	f
5589	No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of its being Miss Price.	3	572	106	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5803	Indeed!	31	631	147	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
5932	When did that happen?	24	649	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6037	I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this.	37	670	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5620	Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you. He is a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character; though, young as you are, and little acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement. With him it is entirely a matter of feeling: he claims no merit in it; perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his constancy has a respectable stamp. Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should have condemned his persevering.	1	605	90	saying	with a mild gravity	f	f	f	f
5621	Indeed, sir, I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I feel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have told him so, that it never will be in my power—	2	605	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5622	My dear, there is no occasion for this. Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are on safe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls, as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see him with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you can, dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leaves Northamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear Fanny, this subject is closed between us.	3	605	90	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
5623	Well, Fanny; Well, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning. I must just speak of it once, I told Sir Thomas I must once, and then I shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.	1	606	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5624	Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!	2	606	89	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5625	My dear aunt, you cannot wish me to do differently from what I have done, I am sure. You cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me, should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.	3	606	92	answered	presently	f	f	f	f
5626	No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as this comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this.	5	606	89	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5627	I will tell you what, Fanny, I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did look remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent Chapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening.	7	606	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5628	And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy.	8	606	89	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5629	We have not been so silent all the time. Fanny has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you coming.” And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. “She often reads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man’s—what’s his name, Fanny?—when we heard your footsteps.	3	607	89	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5630	Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship. I shall find it immediately.	4	607	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5631	That play must be a favourite with you; you read as if you knew it well.	6	607	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5632	It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour; but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an Englishman’s constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.	7	607	96	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5633	No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree from one’s earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk Shakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know him in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent.	8	607	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5634	Sir, you do me honour.	9	607	96	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5635	It was really like being at a play. I wish Sir Thomas had been here.	11	607	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5636	You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford; and I will tell you what, I think you will have a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean when you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk.	13	607	89	said	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
5637	Do you, ma’am? No, no, that will never be. Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!” And he looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant, “That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.	14	607	96	cried	with quickness	f	f	f	f
5638	Even in my profession, how little the art of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good delivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however, than the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the larger number, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading was reading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The subject is more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and besides, there is more general observation and taste, a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge and criticise.	17	607	91	said	with a smile	f	f	f	f
5639	Our liturgy has beauties, which not even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be; that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself. Did you speak?	19	607	96	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5641	Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not allow my thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?	21	607	96	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5642	No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to—even supposing—	22	607	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5643	A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well read. A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon, thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled to the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long worn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or striking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste, or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one could not, in his public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be such a man.	24	607	96	went on	\N	f	f	f	f
5644	I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience. I could not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of estimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.	26	607	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5645	What did that shake of the head mean? What was it meant to express? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying to displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly, irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if I was wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one moment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?	29	607	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5646	Pray, sir, don’t; pray, Mr. Crawford.	30	607	92	repeated	twice over	f	f	f	f
5647	How can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can—]	31	607	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5648	Do I astonish you? Do you wonder? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me an interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity. I will not leave you to wonder long.	32	607	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5649	You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that was the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it, read it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did you think I ought?	34	607	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5650	Perhaps, sir—perhaps, sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment.	35	607	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5667	We are so totally unlike, we are so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together, even if I could like him. There never were two people more dissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.	18	608	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5685	My dearest Fanny, do not let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talked of rather than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise; I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you should be Henry’s wife. And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘Fanny,’ which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality.	18	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5686	And Mrs. Grant, did she say—did she speak; was she there all the time?	19	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5651	Well, I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no wonder that—But we shall see.—It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance, time shall speak for me. They shall prove that, as far as you can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior in merit; all that I know. You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what—not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything like it—but beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay, forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is ‘Fanny’ that I think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.	37	607	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5652	I am come to walk with you, Fanny. Shall I? It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together.	1	608	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5653	But, Fanny, in order to have a comfortable walk, something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what you are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?	3	608	91	added	presently	f	f	f	f
5654	If you hear of it from everybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.	4	608	92	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5655	Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell me them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wish yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.	5	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5656	I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel.	6	608	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5821	I think very differently; an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones. However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.	8	634	151	answered	shortly	f	f	f	f
5825	Oh! Charles is out shooting. I have not seen him since seven o'clock. He would go, though I told him how ill I was. He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one. I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.	9	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5934	Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired. Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home. Here is excellent room for three, I assure you. If we were all like you, I believe we might sit four. You must, indeed, you must.	5	650	152	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6038	I suspect that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall. Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?	39	670	146	said	coolly	f	f	f	f
5657	Do you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be: to the point—I consider Crawford’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his affection. I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him. Can there be any disagreement between us here?	7	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5658	Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. This is such a comfort!	8	608	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5659	This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But how could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general on such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake?	9	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5660	My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.	10	608	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5661	As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be sorry, I may be surprised—though hardly that, for you had not had time to attach yourself—but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him; nothing could have justified your accepting him.	11	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5662	So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here. Crawford’s is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know, must be a work of time. But let him succeed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last. You have proved yourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for.	13	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5663	Oh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me.	14	608	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5664	Never! Fanny!—so very determined and positive! This is not like yourself, your rational self.	15	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5665	I mean that I think I never shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never shall return his regard.	16	608	92	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5666	I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be, that the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice of his intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate, which so many years’ growth have confirmed, and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him. I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had known you as well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have won you. My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed. He should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time, proving him (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by his steady affection, will give him his reward. I cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him—the natural wish of gratitude. You must have some feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference.	17	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5668	You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are quite enough alike. You have tastes in common. You have moral and literary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You forget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I allow. He is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his spirits will support yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are. His cheerfulness will counteract this. He sees difficulties nowhere: and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together: do not imagine it. I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance. I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike: I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners, in the inclination for much or little company, in the propensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay. Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced, friendly to matrimonial happiness. I exclude extremes, of course; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme. A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct.	19	608	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5669	It is not merely in temper that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself; though, in that respect, I think the difference between us too great, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but there is something in him which I object to still more. I must say, cousin, that I cannot approve his character. I have not thought well of him from the time of the play. I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very improperly and unfeelingly—I may speak of it now because it is all over—so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which—in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which will never be got over.	1	609	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5670	My dear Fanny, let us not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect. Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but none so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless. I was playing the fool with my eyes open.	2	609	91	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5671	As a bystander, perhaps I saw more than you did; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.	3	609	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5672	Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole business. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the rest.	4	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5673	Before the play, I am much mistaken if Julia did not think he was paying her attentions.	5	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5822	So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole morning!	3	635	150	greeted	\N	f	f	f	f
5827	Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good. Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.	13	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5674	Julia! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope I do justice to my sisters’ good qualities, I think it very possible that they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford, and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society; and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it may be, a little unthinking, might be led on to—there could be nothing very striking, because it is clear that he had no pretensions: his heart was reserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion. It does him the highest honour; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment. It proves him unspoilt by his uncle. It proves him, in short, everything that I had been used to wish to believe him, and feared he was not.	6	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5675	I am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought, on serious subjects.	7	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5676	Say, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects, which I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise, with such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they are? Crawford’s feelings, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto been too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been good. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature—to a woman who, firm as a rock in her own principles, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them. He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity. He will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy; but you will make him everything.	8	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5677	I would not engage in such a charge; in such an office of high responsibility!	9	609	92	cried	in a shrinking accent	f	f	f	f
5678	As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything too much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in Crawford’s well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first claim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford.	10	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5679	I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday, particularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was very different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk about it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious to know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.	12	609	91	began	again	f	f	f	f
5680	Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?	13	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5681	Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you, Fanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.	14	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5682	It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.	15	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5687	Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The surprise of your refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I said what I could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the case—you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is teasing you. I have done. Do not turn away from me.	20	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5715	I do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your mercy, and when he has got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him. But this I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in love with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to. And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before; that he loves you with all his heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man ever loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.	23	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5823	I am sorry to find you unwell. You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!	5	635	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5828	Well, you will soon be better now. You know I always cure you when I come. How are your neighbours at the Great House?	15	635	148	replied	cheerfully	f	f	f	f
5981	Now Mary, you know very well how it really was. It was all your doing. He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come. That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is.	9	661	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6014	I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance. I suppose I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.	9	666	148	added	\N	f	f	f	f
6015	Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims. In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.	11	666	162	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5688	I should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man’s not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let him be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the perfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself. But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me wholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my situation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they do, must have thought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then, was I to be—to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me? How was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked for? His sisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his deserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of him. And, and—we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.	21	609	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5689	My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the truth; and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them to you before. I thought I could understand you. You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford’s addresses was against him. Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great deal more to the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of your character. Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother. She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time, and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years’ happy marriage.	22	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5690	They go on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either to-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I had almost promised it. What a difference it might have made! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.	24	609	91	observed	soon afterwards	f	f	f	f
5691	You were near staying there?	25	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5692	Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I received any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going on, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long enough.	26	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5693	You spent your time pleasantly there?	27	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5694	Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were all very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with me, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.	28	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5695	The Miss Owens—you liked them, did not you?	29	609	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5696	Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice.	30	609	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5697	I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere.	1	610	95	said	tolerably soon, in a low voice	f	f	f	f
5698	Sad, sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you.	2	610	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5699	Ha!, am I here again? The East room! Once only was I in this room before	3	610	95	cried	with instant animation	f	f	f	f
5700	Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and prompter. A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just in this part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I, here were the chairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?	4	610	95	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5719	I should like to sit talking with you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.	29	610	95	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
6046	Louisa.	18	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5701	The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of it so very—very—what shall I say? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches. ‘When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called a happy life.’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words. It was curious, very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that week—that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be that; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas, that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny, do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though I certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justice now. He is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all.	6	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5702	I have had a little fit since I came into this room, as you may perceive, but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point.	7	610	95	said	presently, with a playful smile	f	f	f	f
5703	Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you.	8	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5704	I hate to leave you. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we shall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear Fanny.	9	610	95	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5705	But you are only going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very particular friend.	10	610	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5706	Yes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But I have not the least inclination to go near her. I can think only of the friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in general. You have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows nothing of. I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off. And when I have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady Stornaway, because she was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have not cared much for her these three years.	11	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5707	How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and setting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea whereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work; and then your cousin’s astonishment, when he opened the door, at seeing me here! To be sure, your uncle’s returning that very evening! There never was anything quite like it.	13	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5708	Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and exigeant, and wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there is attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I had my doubts at the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can think of him with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.	15	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5709	Excellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its course. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some surmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to you at the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received it just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I remember it perfectly.	17	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5710	Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand? Oh! Miss Crawford, that was not fair.	18	610	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5711	Knew of it! It was his own doing entirely, his own thought. I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes.	19	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5712	I will not say that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so, for there was something in your look that frightened me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first—indeed, indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace. As to your brother’s behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I had been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; but then I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply being his way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind. I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing.	20	610	92	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5713	Ah! I cannot deny it. He has now and then been a sad flirt, and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies’ affections. I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault; and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one’s power to pay off the debts of one’s sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman’s nature to refuse such a triumph.	21	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5714	I cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman’s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of.	22	610	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5716	I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother’s commission.	25	610	95	continued	presently	f	f	f	f
5717	Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him.	27	610	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5762	Have you no message for anybody?	20	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6033	How is Mary?, And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?	29	670	151	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5720	I shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there tolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the spring; and your eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again and again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask, Fanny: one is your correspondence. You must write to me. And the other, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for my being gone.	31	610	95	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5722	I do not know how it is; but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father’s. The house is always in confusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You will tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful to Susan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you. How right and comfortable it will all be!	1	612	105	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5723	And I shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything worth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to hear, and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.	1	613	91	added	in a whisper	f	f	f	f
5724	The Thrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers has been here to—	1	614	139	began with	immediately	f	f	f	f
5725	You are just in time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. I saw her. It was a beautiful sight. And they think she will have her orders in a day or two. And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush’s boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go with him.	2	614	140	called out	\N	f	f	f	f
5726	Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have you heard about the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam’s things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.	1	615	141	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5727	To be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour, that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat ashore, I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it. Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no matter; here’s Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the passage? Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.	3	615	105	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5728	Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I began to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching for you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what would you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have got something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better off in our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got.	5	615	141	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5729	Then, Betsey, my dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and tell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish we could get the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.	6	615	141	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5730	Dear me! what a sad fire we have got, and I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer, my dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken care of the fire.	8	615	141	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5731	I was upstairs, mama, moving my things. You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help.	9	615	142	said	in a fearless, self-defending tone	f	f	f	f
5732	Ha! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the news? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the word, you see! By G—, you are just in time! The doctor has been here inquiring for you: he has got one of the boats, and is to be off for Spithead by six, so you had better go with him. I have been to Turner’s about your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder if you had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if you are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G—, I wish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever happens. But by G—, you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time, to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up, and made but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect beauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays at Spithead, and anybody in England would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her. She lays close to the Endymion, between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the sheer hulk.	1	616	143	began	instantly	f	f	f	f
5733	Ha!, that’s just where I should have put her myself. It’s the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is Fanny; it is so dark you do not see her.	2	616	105	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5734	Devil take those young dogs! How they are singing out! Ay, Sam’s voice louder than all the rest! That boy is fit for a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I shall be after you.	1	617	143	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5735	She had been into the kitchen to hurry Sally and help make the toast, and spread the bread and butter, or she did not know when they should have got tea, and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey.	1	618	142	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5736	Her year!; I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year, for that will not be up till November. Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope of ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should only get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is always a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.	1	619	141	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5737	What have you got there, my love?; come and shew it to me.	3	619	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5763	My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him.	21	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5983	I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there. I declare, Anne, he never talks of you at all.	15	661	150	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
5738	It was very hard that she was not to have her own knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had promised her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands.	4	619	142	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5739	Now, Susan, ow, how can you be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish you would not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you to the drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so cross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could but just speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, ‘Let sister Susan have my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.’ Poor little dear! she was so fond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all through her illness. It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death. Poor little sweet creature! Well, she was taken away from evil to come. My own Betsey, you have not the luck of such a good godmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you.	6	619	141	cried	in a complaining voice	f	f	f	f
5740	Take care of Fanny, mother. She is tender, and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you, take care of Fanny.	1	620	105	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5741	It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise	4	621	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5742	Would she not, then, persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure of attending them?	5	621	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5743	Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the town, which they would be very glad to do.	6	621	141	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5744	Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!	1	622	143	calling out	only	f	f	f	f
5745	Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey; what a society will be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth may be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so dear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram once good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two fair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.	1	623	96	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5746	You have been here a month, I think?	2	624	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5747	No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left Mansfield.	3	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5748	You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a month.	4	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5749	I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.	5	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5750	And it is to be a two months’ visit, is not?	6	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5751	Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.	7	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5752	And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?	8	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5753	I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months’ end.	9	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5754	I know Mansfield, I know its way, I know its faults towards you. I know the danger of your being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware that you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt’s maid for you, without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough. I am considering your sister’s health, which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. She requires constant air and exercise. When you know her as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does, and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If, therefore, you find yourself growing unwell, and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two months to be ended, that must not be regarded as of any consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her only the slightest hint, she and I will immediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.	10	624	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5755	I am perfectly serious, as you perfectly know. And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition. Indeed, you shall not; it shall not be in your power; for so long only as you positively say, in every letter to Mary, ‘I am well,’ and I know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be considered as well.	12	624	96	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5756	I wish you were not so tired—I wish I left you in stronger health. Is there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an understanding with him. I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him before. The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow; I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try to displace me; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man, to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than simple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?	14	624	96	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5757	I advise! You know very well what is right.	15	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5758	Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your judgment is my rule of right.	16	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5759	Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you a pleasant journey to-morrow.	17	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5760	Is there nothing I can do for you in town?	18	624	96	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5761	Nothing; I am much obliged to you.	19	624	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5766	Rushworth, sir.	2	625	92	say	\N	f	f	f	f
6158	Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none. You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago. This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe. I am more curious to know why he should be so different now.	127	679	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5769	Then, there’s the devil to pay among them, that’s all! There; much good may such fine relations do you. I don’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less. But, by G—! if she belonged to me, I’d give her the rope’s end as long as I could stand over her. A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things.	6	625	143	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5770	It is a mistake, sir; it must be a mistake, it cannot be true; it must mean some other people.	8	625	92	said	instantly	f	f	f	f
5771	It might be all a lie; but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for anybody.	10	625	143	acknowledged	\N	f	f	f	f
5772	Indeed, I hope it is not true; it would be so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey? And it would not be ten minutes’ work.	11	625	141	said	plaintively	f	f	f	f
5773	My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!	1	626	91	articulate	just	f	f	f	f
5774	Have you breakfasted? When shall you be ready? Does Susan go?	2	626	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5775	No wonder—you must feel it—you must suffer. How a man who had once loved, could desert you! But yours—your regard was new compared with——Fanny, think of me!	1	627	91	said	in a low, but very expressive tone	f	f	f	f
5776	Dear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.	3	628	89	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5777	‘I heard you were in town,’ said she; ‘I wanted to see you. Let us talk over this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?’ I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved. Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then added, ‘I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister’s expense.’ So she began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be repeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon them if I could. Their substance was great anger at the folly of each. She reprobated her brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he adored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear. Guess what I must have felt. To hear the woman whom—no harsher name than folly given! So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it! No reluctance, no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings? This is what the world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!	2	629	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5778	I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She saw it only as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want of common discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power of a servant; it was the detection, in short—oh, Fanny! it was the detection, not the offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her.	3	629	91	went on	with a sort of desperate calmness	f	f	f	f
5779	And what, what could you say?	4	629	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5780	Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She went on, began to talk of you; yes, then she began to talk of you, regretting, as well she might, the loss of such a—. There she spoke very rationally. But she has always done justice to you. ‘He has thrown away,’ said she, ‘such a woman as he will never see again. She would have fixed him; she would have made him happy for ever.’ My dearest Fanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been—but what never can be now. You do not wish me to be silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I have done.	5	629	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5781	Thank God. We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in the midst of it she could exclaim, ‘Why would not she have him? It is all her fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted him as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object. He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again. It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.’ Could you have believed it possible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened.	7	629	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5782	Cruel!, quite cruel. At such a moment to give way to gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.	8	629	92	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5783	Cruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel nature. I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil lies yet deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would speak. Hers are not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but think that for me, for my feelings, she would—. Hers are faults of principle, Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind. Perhaps it is best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however. Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her, rather than have to think of her as I do. I told her so.	9	629	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5785	Yes; when I left her I told her so.	11	629	91	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5786	How long were you together?	12	629	92	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5824	Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure. Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able to ring the bell! So, Lady Russell would not get out. I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.	7	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5829	I can give you no account of them. I have not seen one of them to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me. It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out of their way.	17	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5832	My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner.	23	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5787	Five-and-twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke of it, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can. ‘We must persuade Henry to marry her,’ said she; ‘and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must give up. I do not think that even he could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and when once married, and properly supported by her own family, people of respectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted, but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more liberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise is, that your father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause by interference. Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any officious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry’s protection, there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him. I know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he get his daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.’	13	629	91	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5788	Now, Fanny, I shall soon have done. I have told you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak, I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to make me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions, on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it. That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself, giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best for me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings, hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet, that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished—more than astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely red. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a sort of laugh, as she answered, ‘A pretty good lecture, upon my word. Was it part of your last sermon? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary into foreign parts.’ She tried to speak carelessly, but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear. I only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and immediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard the door open behind me. ‘Mr. Bertram,’ said she. I looked back. ‘Mr. Bertram,’ said she, with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I know I was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This has been the greatest relief, and now we will have done.	14	629	91	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5789	If we can persuade your father to all this, much may be done. If he will adopt these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle. What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do? There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct. I have great hope of prevailing. We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man.	1	630	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5790	hat! every comfort of life knocked off! Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and restrictions every where! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman! No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.	2	630	144	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5791	Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side. It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support. In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household.	7	630	145	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5792	I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter, that the present juncture is much in our favour. This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore. They will be all wanting a home. Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants. Many a noble fortune has been made during the war. If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--	1	631	145	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5793	He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd; that's all I have to remark. A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?	3	631	146	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5794	I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with. I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with. Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying.	7	631	145	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5795	There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.	11	631	146	observed	sarcastically	f	f	f	f
5796	They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune: but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant. I have known a good deal of the profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful in all their ways! These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe. Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now. You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected.	13	631	147	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5797	As to all that, supposing I were induced to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it. I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant. The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing. I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden. I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.	15	631	146	rejoined	coolly	f	f	f	f
5798	In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant. Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands. Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights. I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.	19	631	145	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5799	The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.	23	631	148	spoke	\N	f	f	f	f
5804	Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it. First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man. I have observed it all my life. A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line. One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. 'In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley). 'Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin. What do you take his age to be?' 'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil, 'forty, and no more.' Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin. I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen. It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age.	33	631	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5805	Nay, Sir Walter, this is being severe indeed. Have a little mercy on the poor men. We are not all born to be handsome. The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth. But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other? Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time. The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere. In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.	35	631	147	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5806	And who is Admiral Croft?	39	631	146	inquiry	cold suspicious	f	f	f	f
5807	He is a rear admiral of the white. He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years.	43	631	148	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5808	Then I take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.	45	631	146	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
5809	And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be; asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?	51	631	145	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5810	I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.	55	631	147	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5811	Bless me! how very odd! I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose. A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an amicable compromise. Very odd indeed!	57	631	145	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5812	You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?	61	631	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5813	Wentworth was the very name! Mr Wentworth was the very man. He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two or three years. Came there about the year ---5, I take it. You remember him, I am sure.	65	631	145	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5814	Wentworth? Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford. You misled me by the term gentleman. I thought you were speaking of some man of property: Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family. One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.	67	631	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5815	A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.	77	631	148	said	with a gentle sigh	f	f	f	f
5816	I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton. The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.	1	632	149	observed	with sympathetic cordiality	f	f	f	f
5817	I cannot possibly do without Anne.	1	633	150	reasoning	\N	f	f	f	f
5818	Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.	2	633	151	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
5819	Mrs Clay never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people. And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now. If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety. One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. That tooth of her's and those freckles. Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him. I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them. You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's freckles.	4	634	151	said	warmly	f	f	f	f
5820	There is hardly any personal defect which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.	6	634	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5826	You have had your little boys with you?	11	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5834	A great many things, I assure you. More than I can recollect in a moment; but I can tell you some. I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures. I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell. I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave. I was told that they wished it. But all these things took up a great deal of time.	27	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5835	Oh! well!, but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.	29	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5836	Did you go then? I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party.	31	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5837	Oh yes! I went. I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning. It would have been strange if I had not gone.	33	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5838	I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.	35	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5839	Nothing remarkable. One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one's own. Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward. So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.	37	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5840	Where shall we go? I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?	41	635	150	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5841	I have not the smallest objection on that account. I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.	43	635	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5842	Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible. They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister. However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk.	45	635	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5843	Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch? I am glad I did not think of it before. How low it makes me!	1	636	150	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5844	Nobody knew how much she should suffer. She should put it off as long as she could.	2	636	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5845	It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.	1	637	152	saying	suddenly	f	f	f	f
5846	Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?	6	637	152	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5847	We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you know him by name.	12	637	149	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5848	And I will tell you our reason, and all about it. I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte. I will tell you why she is out of spirits. When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow! And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard! So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.	18	637	153	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5849	the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.	4	638	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5850	Oh! no, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything should happen?	5	638	150	opposed	eagerly	f	f	f	f
5851	Nothing can be going on better than the child; so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right. Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use. Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.	4	639	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5852	So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how it would be. This is always my luck. If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is as bad as any of them. Very unfeeling! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy. Talks of his being going on so well! How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling. So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child. My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried. I am not at all equal to it. You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.	8	639	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5853	But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the shock. You will not be hysterical again. I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us. I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband. Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province. A sick child is always the mother's property: her own feelings generally make it so.	10	639	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5854	I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about. I have not nerves for the sort of thing.	12	639	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5855	But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?	14	639	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5856	Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I? Jemima is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was. I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come. I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is. I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.	16	639	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5857	Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your husband. Leave little Charles to my care. Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him.	18	639	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5858	Are you serious? Dear me! that's a very good thought, very good, indeed. To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I? and it only harasses me. You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest person. You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word. It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima. Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne. I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly. You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you. I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child.	20	639	150	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5859	I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than you are. If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like. Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him. It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.	24	639	150	saying	in a tone of great exultation	f	f	f	f
5860	This is very kind of Anne, and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.	26	639	154	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5861	Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so attentive to me. Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not have known you again.'	5	640	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5862	Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match. Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man. Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?	19	641	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5863	A strong mind, with sweetness of manner	21	641	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5864	That is the woman I want. Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much. If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men.	23	641	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5865	Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.	5	642	156	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5866	Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.	11	643	157	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5867	You will not find her there. Quite worn out and broken up. I was the last man who commanded her. Hardly fit for service then. Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West Indies.	13	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5868	The Admiralty entertain themselves now and then, with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed. But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.	17	643	155	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5869	Phoo! phoo!, what stuff these young fellows talk! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day. For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal. Lucky fellow to get her! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time. Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his.	19	643	149	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5870	I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you. I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire. It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.	21	643	155	replied	seriously	f	f	f	f
5871	To be sure you did. What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together? If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again.	23	643	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5873	I knew pretty well what she was before that day. I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself. Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me. She did all that I wanted. I knew she would. I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted. I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck. We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition. Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.	27	643	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5874	And so then, I suppose, so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear, do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother. I always forgot.	29	643	156	said	in a low voice	f	f	f	f
5875	It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know. Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.	31	643	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5876	Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend.	33	643	156	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5877	Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia! How fast I made money in her. A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands. Poor Harville, sister! You know how much he wanted money: worse than myself. He had a wife. Excellent fellow. I shall never forget his happiness. He felt it all, so much for her sake. I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.	39	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5878	And I am sure, Sir, it was a lucky day for us, when you were put captain into that ship. We shall never forget what you did.	41	643	156	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5879	My brother; mamma is thinking of poor Richard.	45	643	158	whispered	\N	f	f	f	f
5880	Poor dear fellow!; he was grown so steady, and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care! Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you. I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.	47	643	156	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5882	Should I? I am glad I was not a week later then.	59	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5883	But, if I know myself, this is from no want of gallantry towards them. It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have. There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do. I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.	63	643	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5884	Oh! Frederick! But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle refinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England. I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war. I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall, beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.	67	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5885	Nothing to the purpose. You were living with your husband, and were the only woman on board.	69	643	155	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5886	But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth. Where was this superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?	71	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5887	All merged in my friendship, Sophia. I would assist any brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it. But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself.	73	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5888	Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.	75	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5889	I might not like them the better for that perhaps. Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.	77	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5890	My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly. Pray, what would become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?	79	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5891	My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth.	81	643	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5892	But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.	83	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5893	Ah! my dear, when he had got a wife, he will sing a different tune. When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done. We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife.	85	643	149	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5894	Ay, that we shall.	87	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5895	Now I have done. When once married people begin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently, when you are married.' I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then they say again, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.	89	643	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5896	What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!	93	643	156	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5897	Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more. I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar. But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies. We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.	95	643	152	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5898	And I do assure you, ma'am, that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates. When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship. While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared. Thank God! I have always been blessed with excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me. A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards. The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas. I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.	99	643	152	pursued	\N	f	f	f	f
5899	Aye, to be sure. Yes, indeed, oh yes! I am quite of your opinion, Mrs Croft. There is nothing so bad as a separation. I am quite of your opinion. I know what it is, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again.	101	643	156	answer	hearty	f	f	f	f
5900	I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat.	109	644	155	said	with studied politeness	f	f	f	f
5901	had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war. Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy. Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.	3	645	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5902	Upon my word it would. Dear me! If he should rise to any very great honours! If he should ever be made a baronet! 'Lady Wentworth' sounds very well. That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Henrietta! She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that. Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.	5	645	150	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
5872	But, Captain Wentworth, how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.	25	643	158	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5903	You know, I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away. I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them. And, pray, who is Charles Hayter? Nothing but a country curate. A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross.	9	645	150	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5933	I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time; but I believe about a year before he married Mary. I wish she had accepted him. We should all have liked her a great deal better; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's doing, that she did not. They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.	26	649	157	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6034	They come on the Admiral's account. He is thought to be gouty.	31	670	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5904	Now you are talking nonsense, Mary. It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property. The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country. I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property. No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.	13	645	154	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
5905	Charles may say what he pleases, but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has. She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday. I wish you had been there to see her behaviour. And as to Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best. But Charles is so positive! I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me.	15	645	150	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5906	Well, I am very glad indeed: but I always thought you would have it; I always thought you sure. It did not appear to me that--in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise. Is he coming, Louisa?	4	646	153	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5907	I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here.	4	647	155	say	only	f	f	f	f
5908	They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few moments, I dare say.	6	647	148	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
5909	I hope the little boy is better.	8	647	155	saying	politely	f	f	f	f
5910	How do you do? Will you not sit down? The others will be here presently.	12	647	148	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5911	Walter, get down this moment. You are extremely troublesome. I am very angry with you.	20	647	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5912	Walter, why do you not do as you are bid? Do not you hear your aunt speak? Come to me, Walter, come to cousin Charles.	22	647	159	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5913	Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk.	9	648	150	replied	immediately	f	f	f	f
5914	I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk. Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased, if we had refused to join them. When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?	11	648	150	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5915	What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister! They meant to take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills. They talked of coming into this side of the country. I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day. Oh! it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as lieve be tossed out as not.	17	648	155	added	\N	f	f	f	f
5916	Ah! You make the most of it, I know, but if it were really so, I should do just the same in her place. If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.	19	648	157	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5917	Had you?; I honour you!	23	648	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5918	Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?	25	648	148	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5919	Bless me! here is Winthrop. I declare I had no idea! Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.	31	648	150	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
5921	No, no!	35	648	157	cried	more eagerly	f	f	f	f
5922	Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good.	37	648	150	answered	resolutely	f	f	f	f
5923	It is very unpleasant, having such connexions! But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life.	41	648	150	saying	\N	f	f	f	f
5924	And so, I made her go. I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense. What! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say? No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded. When I have made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!	5	649	157	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5925	She would have turned back then, but for you?	7	649	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5926	She would indeed. I am almost ashamed to say it.	9	649	157	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5927	Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand! After the hints you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last time I was in company with him, I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on. I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this. Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness, I see. If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can. But this, no doubt, you have been always doing. It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on. You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody may sway it. Let those who would be happy be firm. Here is a nut to exemplify: a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has outlived all the storms of autumn. Not a puncture, not a weak spot anywhere. This nut, while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of.	11	649	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5928	My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm. If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind.	12	649	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5929	Mary is good-natured enough in many respects; but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot pride. She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride. We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead. I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?	15	649	157	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5935	He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy; but there is no saying which. He has been running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind. Ay, this comes of the peace. If it were war now, he would have settled it long ago. We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war. How many days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?	13	651	149	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5936	We had better not talk about it, my dear; for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together. I had known you by character, however, long before.	15	651	152	replied	pleasantly	f	f	f	f
5937	Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides? I do not like having such things so long in hand. I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch. Then there would always be company for them. And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other.	17	651	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5938	Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed; and a very respectable family. One could not be connected with better people. My dear Admiral, that post! we shall certainly take that post.	19	651	152	said	in a tone of calmer praise	f	f	f	f
5939	Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good. There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month. He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again. Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea. I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme. Do not you, Anne? Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley? She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand, in case of his having another seizure. Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out from all the world. I wish his friends would propose it to him. I really think they ought. And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character. My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish. He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say. Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person? And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of.	5	652	153	began with	suddenly, again	f	f	f	f
5940	I wish, I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley. I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything! I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.	9	652	153	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5941	Ah!, it is the very man we passed.	7	653	155	cried	instantly	f	f	f	f
5942	Pray, can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away?	11	653	155	said	immediately	f	f	f	f
5943	Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night from Sidmouth. Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London.	13	653	160	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5944	Bless me!; it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot, it must, indeed! Charles, Anne, must not it? In mourning, you see, just as our Mr Elliot must be. How very extraordinary! In the very same inn with us! Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot? my father's next heir? Pray sir, did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family?	17	653	150	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5945	No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.	19	653	160	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5946	There! you see!, just as I said! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot! I was sure that would come out, if it was so. Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish, wherever he goes. But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary! I wish I had looked at him more. I wish we had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us. What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance? I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me! Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning, one should have known him by the livery.	21	653	150	cried	in an ecstasy	f	f	f	f
5947	Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together, we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.	23	653	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5948	Of course, you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the next time you write to Bath. I think my father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.	29	653	150	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5949	Miss Elliot, you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much. I wish he could have such company oftener. It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do? We cannot part.	6	654	161	said	rather low	f	f	f	f
5950	No, that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.	8	654	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5951	Ay, true enough, only June.	10	654	161	\N	with a deep sigh	f	f	f	f
5952	And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.	12	654	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5980	Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd young man. I do not know what he would be at. We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come. I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.	7	661	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5953	Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler. I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth. There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm. Nobody could do it, but that good fellow. The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being sent to sea again. He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week. That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James. You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!	14	654	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5954	I am determined I will.	3	655	157	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5955	She is dead! she is dead!	5	655	150	screamed	\N	f	f	f	f
5956	Is there no one to help me?	7	655	155	burst	in a tone of despair	f	f	f	f
5957	Go to him, go to him, for heaven's sake go to him. I can support her myself. Leave me, and go to him. Rub her hands, rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.	9	655	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5958	Oh God! her father and mother!	13	655	155	exclaimed	in the bitterest agony	f	f	f	f
5959	A surgeon!	15	655	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5960	True, true, a surgeon this instant.	17	655	155	saying	only	f	f	f	f
5961	Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick? He knows where a surgeon is to be found.	19	655	148	suggested	eagerly	f	f	f	f
5962	Anne, Anne, What is to be done next? What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?	27	655	154	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5963	Had not she better be carried to the inn? Yes, I am sure: carry her gently to the inn.	31	655	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5964	Yes, yes, to the inn. I will carry her myself. Musgrove, take care of the others.	33	655	155	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
5965	We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute. Every minute is valuable. Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly. Musgrove, either you or I must go.	5	656	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5966	Then it is settled, Musgrove, that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home. But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one. Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne.	11	656	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5967	You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her.	15	656	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5968	It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.	16	656	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5969	Don't talk of it, don't talk of it. Oh God! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment! Had I done as I ought! But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!	5	657	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
5970	I have been considering what we had best do. She must not appear at first. She could not stand it. I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove. Do you think this is a good plan?	11	657	155	said	in a low, cautious voice	f	f	f	f
5971	She really left nothing for Mary to do. He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night. Mary had been hysterical again this morning. When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good. He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.	5	658	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5972	I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon. Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house? It will be some trial to us both.	4	659	144	\N	in a decided tone	f	f	f	f
5973	I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine. By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.	9	659	148	observing	\N	f	f	f	f
5974	Ay, a very bad business indeed. A new sort of way this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it, Miss Elliot? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!	5	660	149	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
5975	Now, this must be very bad for you, to be coming and finding us here. I had not recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad. But now, do not stand upon ceremony. Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it.	9	660	149	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5976	Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.	11	660	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5977	Well, whenever it suits you. You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door. A good place is not it? But, you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the butler's room. Ay, so it always is, I believe. One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best. And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not.	13	660	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5978	We have made very few changes either. Very few. We told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross. That has been a very great improvement. The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had. Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better. My wife should have the credit of them, however. I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's. A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot, I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life. Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away from one's self. So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near.	17	660	149	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
5979	The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place. The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three times a winter. And take it altogether, now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we like better than this. Pray say so, with my compliments. He will be glad to hear it.	21	660	149	say	\N	f	f	f	f
5982	Oh! he talks of you in such terms--	13	661	154	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6036	Have they any acquaintance here?	35	670	151	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
5984	No, I do not know that he ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly. His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room. 'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms.	17	661	154	admitted	\N	f	f	f	f
5985	And I am sure it was a very little to his credit, if he did. Miss Harville only died last June. Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell? I am sure you will agree with me.	19	661	150	cried	warmly	f	f	f	f
5986	I must see Captain Benwick before I decide.	21	661	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5987	And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am. Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it. I told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon. So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.	23	661	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5988	Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me.	25	661	144	answer	kind	f	f	f	f
5989	Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance, I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.	27	661	150	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5990	Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick.	29	661	144	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5991	You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am. He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived. He has walked with me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word. He is not at all a well-bred young man. I am sure you will not like him.	31	661	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5992	There we differ, Mary. I think Lady Russell would like him. I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner.	33	661	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5993	So do I, Anne. I am sure Lady Russell would like him. He is just Lady Russell's sort. Give him a book, and he will read all day long.	35	661	154	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5994	Yes, that he will! He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drops one's scissors, or anything that happens. Do you think Lady Russell would like that?	37	661	150	exclaimed	tauntingly	f	f	f	f
5995	Upon my word, I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself. I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions. I wish he may be induced to call here. And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.	39	661	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5996	You will not like him, I will answer for it.	41	661	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
5997	He is a man whom I have no wish to see. His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.	45	661	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5998	I hope I shall remember, in future, not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays.	5	662	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
5999	How is Mary looking? The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day.	3	663	146	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6000	Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental. In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.	5	663	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6001	If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.	7	663	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6002	Well, it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.	13	663	162	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6003	The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world. The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.	15	663	162	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6004	less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher. Had she been using any thing in particular?	3	664	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6005	No, nothing.	5	664	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6006	Merely Gowland.	7	664	146	supposed	\N	f	f	f	f
6007	No, nothing at all.	9	664	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6008	Ha! he was surprised at that.	10	664	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6009	certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months. Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her. You see how it has carried away her freckles.	12	664	146	added	\N	f	f	f	f
6010	Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.	4	665	144	reply	cautious	f	f	f	f
6011	My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.	3	666	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6012	You are mistaken, that is not good company; that is the best. Good company requires only birth, education, and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice. Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well. My cousin Anne shakes her head. She is not satisfied. She is fastidious. My dear cousin" (sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer? Will it make you happy? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible? You may depend upon it, that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.	5	666	162	said	gently	f	f	f	f
6013	Yes, we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!	7	666	148	sighed	\N	f	f	f	f
6016	Well, I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place.	13	666	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6017	I love your indignation; it is very natural. But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot. You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little different. In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin," (he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) "in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike. We must feel that every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.	15	666	162	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6018	And she, besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance. As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood. She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise. She always takes the right time for applying. Everybody's heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak. She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman. Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to. Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one's species better. One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly. To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.	3	667	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6019	I can easily believe it. Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to. Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing! And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting. What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most. A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes.	5	667	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6020	Yes, sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe. Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of. There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.	7	667	163	said	more doubtingly	f	f	f	f
6021	I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me. She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery. I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however. She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now.	11	667	163	added	in a different tone	f	f	f	f
6022	Westgate Buildings!, and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings? A Mrs Smith. A widow Mrs Smith; and who was her husband? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere. And what is her attraction? That she is old and sickly. Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste! Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you. But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day. What is her age? Forty?	3	668	146	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6023	No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself. She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.	5	668	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6024	But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?	7	668	151	asked	\N	f	f	f	f
6025	She sees nothing to blame in it; on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith.	9	668	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6026	Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement. Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms, but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot. A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings! A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland! Mrs Smith! Such a name!	11	668	146	observed	\N	f	f	f	f
6027	I am no match-maker, as you well know, being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations. I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together. A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one.	3	669	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6028	Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him; but we should not suit.	5	669	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6029	I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me. You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued! My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!	7	669	144	said	in rejoinder	f	f	f	f
6030	What is this? The Crofts have arrived in Bath? The Crofts who rent Kellynch? What have they brought you?	3	670	146	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6031	A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.	5	670	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6032	Oh! those letters are convenient passports. They secure an introduction. I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate. I know what is due to my tenant.	7	670	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6035	Gout and decrepitude! Poor old gentleman.	33	670	146	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6039	Oh, no! I think not. Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins, we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve. If we were not related, it would not signify; but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours. We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level. There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors. The Crofts will associate with them.	41	670	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6040	Ha! is it you? Thank you, thank you. This is treating me like a friend. Here I am, you see, staring at a picture. I can never get by this shop without stopping. But what a thing here is, by way of a boat! Do look at it. Did you ever see the like? What queer fellows your fine painters must be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be. I wonder where that boat was built! I would not venture over a horsepond in it. Well, now, where are you bound? Can I go anywhere for you, or with you? Can I be of any use?	3	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6041	None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together. I am going home.	5	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6042	That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too. Yes, yes we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go along. There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there. Lord! what a boat it is!	8	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6043	Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?	10	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6044	Yes, I have, presently. But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however. I shall not stop. 'How d'ye do?' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife. She, poor soul, is tied by the leg. She has a blister on one of her heels, as large as a three-shilling piece. If you look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother. Shabby fellows, both of them! I am glad they are not on this side of the way. Sophy cannot bear them. They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men. I will tell you the whole story another time. There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson. Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife. Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker. Poor old Sir Archibald! How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? It suits us very well. We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal. We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth. The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.	12	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6045	Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you. But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about. That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned for. The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to. Her Christian name: I always forget her Christian name.	15	671	149	began	\N	f	f	f	f
6047	Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name. I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names. I should never be out if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort. Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick. He was courting her week after week. The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right. But even then there was something odd in their way of going on. Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward. When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since. We have seen nothing of him since November. Even Sophy could not understand it. But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick. You know James Benwick.	20	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6048	A little. I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.	22	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6049	Well, she is to marry him. Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.	24	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6050	I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man, and I understand that he bears an excellent character.	26	671	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6051	Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick. He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of. An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.	28	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6052	Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick's manners. I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.	30	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6053	Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his. There is something about Frederick more to our taste.	32	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6054	I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends	34	671	148	say	\N	f	f	f	f
6055	And the thing is certainly true. It is not a mere bit of gossip. We have it from Frederick himself. His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross. I fancy they are all at Uppercross.	36	671	149	interrupted	\N	f	f	f	f
6056	I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy. It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally, and without violence. I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.	38	671	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6057	Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end.	40	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6058	No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that. If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him.	44	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6119	I have been a good deal acquainted with him, but it seems worn out now. It is a great while since we met.	38	679	163	replied	gravely	f	f	f	f
6159	But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.	129	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6060	Yes, yes, I understand you. But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter. He does not give the least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.' No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself. He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think.	48	671	149	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6059	Certainly. But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely said. I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.	46	671	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6061	Poor Frederick! Now he must begin all over again with somebody else. I think we must get him to Bath. Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath. Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure. It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson. Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?	52	671	149	said	at last	f	f	f	f
6062	I am much obliged to you, but I am not going with them. The carriage would not accommodate so many. I walk: I prefer walking.	5	672	148	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
6063	But it rains.	7	672	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6064	Oh! very little, Nothing that I regard.	9	672	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6065	Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see; I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair.	11	672	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6066	I am only waiting for Mr Elliot. He will be here in a moment, I am sure.	13	672	148	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
6067	Good morning to you!	15	672	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6068	Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?	4	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6069	Oh! no, that is clear enough. One can guess what will happen there. He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe. What a very good-looking man!	7	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6070	Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.	9	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6071	She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to look at her. It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire her more than her sister.	11	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6072	Oh! so do I.	13	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6073	And so do I. No comparison. But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot. Anne is too delicate for them.	15	673	164	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6074	You will wonder what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night. They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.	5	674	144	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6075	By all means; only tell me all about it, when you do come. Who is your party?	5	675	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6076	Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you.	7	675	163	said	with an expression half serious, half arch	f	f	f	f
6077	I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme. I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you at the time.	5	676	155	said	with a little smile, a little glow	f	f	f	f
6078	It was a frightful hour, a frightful day!	9	676	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6079	The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful. When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.	10	676	155	added	\N	f	f	f	f
6080	Certainly I could have none. But it appears--I should hope it would be a very happy match. There are on both sides good principles and good temper.	12	676	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6081	Yes; but there, I think, ends the resemblance. With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it. They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays. The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort. All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps--	14	676	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6082	I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than mind. I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more. He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise. Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing. But I have no reason to suppose it so. It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me. A man like him, in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment. A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman. He ought not; he does not.	18	676	155	proceeded	thus	f	f	f	f
6083	You were a good while at Lyme, I think?	22	676	148	say	\N	f	f	f	f
6120	I was not at all aware of this. You never mentioned it before. Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.	40	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6084	About a fortnight. I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was quite ascertained. I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace. It had been my doing, solely mine. She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak. The country round Lyme is very fine. I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the more I found to admire.	24	676	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6085	I should very much like to see Lyme again.	26	676	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6086	Indeed! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling. The horror and distress you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.	28	676	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6087	The last hours were certainly very painful; but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure. One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at Lyme. We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment. So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in short altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.	30	676	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6088	This is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language. I am a very poor Italian scholar.	5	677	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6089	Yes, yes, I see you are. I see you know nothing of the matter. You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear, comprehensible, elegant English. You need not say anything more of your ignorance. Here is complete proof.	7	677	162	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6090	I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient.	9	677	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6091	I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman.	11	677	162	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6092	For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery. I forget what we are to have next.	13	677	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6093	Perhaps I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.	15	677	162	said	speaking low	f	f	f	f
6094	Indeed! How so? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family.	17	677	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6095	I knew you by report long before you came to Bath. I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately. I have been acquainted with you by character many years. Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.	19	677	162	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6096	No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now. He would mention no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact. He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the warmest curiosity to know her.	23	677	162	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6097	The name of Anne Elliot has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.	27	677	162	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6098	A well-looking man, a very well-looking man.	31	677	146	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6099	A very fine young man indeed! More air than one often sees in Bath. Irish, I dare say.	33	677	165	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6100	No, I just know his name. A bowing acquaintance. Wentworth; Captain Wentworth of the navy. His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.	35	677	146	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6101	He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.	5	678	155	accosted	\N	f	f	f	f
6102	Is not this song worth staying for?	7	678	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6103	No!, there is nothing worth my staying for.	9	678	155	replied	impressively	f	f	f	f
6104	The little Durands were there, I conclude, with their mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed. They never miss a concert.	5	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6105	Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room.	7	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6106	The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.	9	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6107	I do not know. I do not think they were.	11	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6108	Old Lady Mary Maclean? I need not ask after her. She never misses, I know; and you must have seen her. She must have been in your own circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur, round the orchestra, of course.	13	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6109	No, that was what I dreaded. It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect. But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.	15	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6110	Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement. I can understand. There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this you had. You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing beyond.	17	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6111	But I ought to have looked about me more	19	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6112	No, no; you were better employed. You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening. I see it in your eye. I perfectly see how the hours passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to. In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.	21	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6113	Do you see that in my eye?	23	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6114	Yes, I do. Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together.	25	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6115	And such being the case, I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning. It is really very good of you to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.	29	679	163	continued	after a short pause	f	f	f	f
6116	Pray, is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me? Does he know that I am in Bath?	33	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6117	Mr Elliot!	35	679	148	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
6118	Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?	36	679	148	added	more composedly	f	f	f	f
6121	To confess the truth, that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have. I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot. I want your interest with him. He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness, my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is done.	42	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6161	The language, I know, is highly disrespectful. Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning. But it shows you the man. Mark his professions to my poor husband. Can any thing be stronger?	143	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6162	Thank you. This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you were saying. But why be acquainted with us now?	147	679	148	say	\N	f	f	f	f
6122	I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you; but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater right to influence him, than is really the case. I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion. You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation. If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.	44	679	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6123	I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon. I ought to have waited for official information. But now, my dear Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak. Next week? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.	48	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6124	No, nor next week, nor next, nor next. I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week. I am not going to marry Mr Elliot. I should like to know why you imagine I am?	50	679	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6125	Now, how I do wish I understood you! How I do wish I knew what you were at! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs. Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody. It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers. But why should you be cruel? Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend. Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man? Let me recommend Mr Elliot. I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?	54	679	163	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
6126	My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half a year. He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one.	56	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6127	Oh! if these are your only objections, Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him. Do not forget me when you are married, that's all. Let him know me to be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps. Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same. Of course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me. Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy. Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman. Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been. You are safe in all worldly matters, and safe in his character. He will not be led astray; he will not be misled by others to his ruin.	58	679	163	cried	archly	f	f	f	f
6128	No, I can readily believe all that of my cousin. He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous impressions. I consider him with great respect. I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise. But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be known intimately soon. Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me? Surely this must be calm enough. And, upon my word, he is nothing to me. Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him. I assure you I shall not. I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford: not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--	60	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6129	Do tell me how it first came into your head.	64	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6130	It first came into my head upon finding how much you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way. But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.	66	679	163	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6131	And has it indeed been spoken of?	68	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6132	Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday?	70	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6133	No. Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid? I observed no one in particular.	72	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6134	It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in. She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot. She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority. She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.	74	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6135	The whole history. She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.	75	679	148	repeated	\N	f	f	f	f
6136	But, though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could. Shall I mention to him your being in Bath? Shall I take any message?	79	679	148	continued	presently	f	f	f	f
6137	No, I thank you: no, certainly not. In the warmth of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances; but not now. No, I thank you, I have nothing to trouble you with.	81	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6138	I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?	83	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6140	Not before he was married, I suppose?	87	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6141	Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.	89	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6142	And--were you much acquainted?	91	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6144	Indeed! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life. I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man. Was he at all such as he appears now?	95	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6145	I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years.	97	679	163	answer	gravely	f	f	f	f
6189	I am extremely glad, indeed, particularly glad that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort. I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.	5	682	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6160	This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him. The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine. But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed. Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy. I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it.	133	679	163	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6146	I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot, I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do. I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you. There were many things to be taken into the account. One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief. Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may be nothing durable beneath. However, I have determined; I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real character. Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may happen. You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him. Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character. He has no feeling for others. Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction. He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion. Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!	99	679	163	cried	in her natural tone of cordiality	f	f	f	f
6147	My expressions startle you. You must allow for an injured, angry woman. But I will try to command myself. I will not abuse him. I will only tell you what I have found him. Facts shall speak. He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself. The intimacy had been formed before our marriage. I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him. At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together. We were principally in town, living in very good style. He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman. He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother. My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I know that he often assisted him.	103	679	163	added	\N	f	f	f	f
6148	This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life, which has always excited my particular curiosity. It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister. I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times. It seemed to announce a different sort of man.	105	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6149	I know it all, I know it all. He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of them for ever. I know he was invited and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go. I can satisfy you, perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time. I was privy to all the fors and againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer any question you may wish to put.	107	679	163	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6150	Nay, I have no particular enquiry to make about her. I have always understood they were not a happy couple. But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did. My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him. Why did Mr Elliot draw back?	109	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6151	Mr Elliot, at that period of his life, had one object in view: to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process than the law. He was determined to make it by marriage. He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence. That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you. He told me the whole story. He had no concealments with me. It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father and sister. He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.	111	679	163	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6152	Perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot?	113	679	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6153	To be sure I did; very often. I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot, and vouch for your being a very different creature from--	115	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6154	This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night. This explains it. I found he had been used to hear of me. I could not comprehend how. What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned! How sure to be mistaken! But I beg your pardon; I have interrupted you. Mr Elliot married then completely for money? The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his character.	119	679	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6155	Oh! those things are too common. When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought. I was very young, and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any strict rules of conduct. We lived for enjoyment. I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing. 'To do the best for himself,' passed as a duty.	121	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6157	Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard. Money, money, was all that he wanted. Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been a butcher, but that was all nothing. She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth. All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself. Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it. His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt. I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject. It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.	125	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6163	I can explain this too.	149	679	163	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6165	Yes. I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now. I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing. He is no hypocrite now. He truly wants to marry you. His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart. I will give you my authority: his friend Colonel Wallis.	153	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6166	Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?	155	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6167	No. It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence. The stream is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away. Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her. She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me. On Monday evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings. When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.	157	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6168	My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient. This will not do. Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father. That was all prior to my coming to Bath. I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived.	159	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6169	I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--	161	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6170	Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such a line. Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left.	163	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6171	Only give me a hearing. You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm. Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement. He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you. So says my historian, at least. Is this true? Did he see you last summer or autumn, 'somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?	165	679	163	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6172	He certainly did. So far it is very true. At Lyme. I happened to be at Lyme.	167	679	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6173	Well, grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted. He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there. But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain. If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.	169	679	163	continued	triumphantly	f	f	f	f
6238	We never shall. We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point. It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.	62	686	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6174	This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail. Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man. Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling. He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William. You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material. This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could. He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced. Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay. He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.	173	679	163	continued	\N	f	f	f	f
6175	Yes, you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine. There is always something offensive in the details of cunning. The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me. I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied. I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared. I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not.	175	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6176	Lessening, I understand. He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence. But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence. Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay. A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. 'Why, to be sure, ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.' And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match. She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?	177	679	163	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6177	I am very glad to know all this. It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do. My line of conduct will be more direct. Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness.	179	679	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6178	My dear, there was nothing else to be done. I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband. My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless. He was very unkind to his first wife. They were wretched together. But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her. I was willing to hope that you must fare better.	195	679	163	reply	\N	f	f	f	f
6179	I had not the smallest intention of asking him, but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at least.	3	680	151	said	with affected carelessness	f	f	f	f
6180	Indeed, I do say it. I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation. Poor man! I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.	5	680	147	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6181	Oh!, I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints. However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together. They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so pleasantly. Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.	7	680	151	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6182	Quite delightful! Exactly like father and son! Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?	9	680	147	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6183	Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words. If you will have such ideas! But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men.	11	680	151	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6184	My dear Miss Elliot!	13	680	147	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
6185	Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him. I did invite him, you know. I sent him away with smiles. When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.	15	680	151	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6186	Very well, I have nothing to send but my love. Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through. I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out. Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications. You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night. I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert. Something so formal and arrangé in her air! and she sits so upright! My best love, of course.	5	681	151	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6187	And mine. Kindest regards. And you may say, that I mean to call upon her soon. Make a civil message; but I shall only leave my card. Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little. If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.	7	681	146	added	\N	f	f	f	f
6188	And a very good living it was: only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire. In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation. Not that he will value it as he ought, Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.	3	682	154	added/observed	\N	f	f	f	f
6190	Oh! yes. My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer, but he has no other fault to find. Money, you know, coming down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation, and it streightens him as to many things. However, I do not mean to say they have not a right to it. It is very fit they should have daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind, liberal father to me. Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match. She never did, you know. But she does not do him justice, nor think enough about Winthrop. I cannot make her attend to the value of the property. It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.	7	682	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6191	Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be happy in their children's marriages. They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure. What a blessing to young people to be in such hands! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old. I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now?	9	682	148	exclaimed	\N	f	f	f	f
6192	Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different. If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long.	11	682	154	answered	rather hesitatingly	f	f	f	f
6193	That cannot be much to your taste, I know; but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.	13	682	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6194	To be sure he is. Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself. I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say. His reading has done him no harm, for he has fought as well as read. He is a brave fellow. I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before. We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since.	15	682	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6195	Anne, there is Mrs Clay, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her. I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now. They seemed deep in talk. Who is it? Come, and tell me. Good heavens! I recollect. It is Mr Elliot himself.	5	683	150	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6196	No, it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you. He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow.	7	683	148	cried	quickly	f	f	f	f
6197	Do come, Anne, come and look yourself. You will be too late if you do not make haste. They are parting; they are shaking hands. He is turning away. Not know Mr Elliot, indeed! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme.	13	683	150	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6198	Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly. He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be mistaken, I might not attend.	15	683	148	said	calmly	f	f	f	f
6199	Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like. I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night. A'n't I a good boy? I know you love a play; and there is room for us all. It holds nine. I have engaged Captain Wentworth. Anne will not be sorry to join us, I am sure. We all like a play. Have not I done well, mother?	19	683	154	began	\N	f	f	f	f
6200	Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing? Take a box for to-morrow night! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them? How can you be so forgetful?	23	683	150	exclaiming	\N	f	f	f	f
6201	Phoo! phoo!, what's an evening party? Never worth remembering. Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us. You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play.	25	683	154	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6202	Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go.	27	683	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6203	No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word 'happy.' There was no promise.	29	683	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6204	But you must go, Charles. It would be unpardonable to fail. We were asked on purpose to be introduced. There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves. Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately. We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot. Consider, my father's heir: the future representative of the family.	31	683	150	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6205	Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives. I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun. If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir. What is Mr Elliot to me?	33	683	154	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6206	We had better put it off. Charles, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday. It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Anne could not be with us.	37	683	156	interposed	\N	f	f	f	f
6207	If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home (excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment. I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you. But, it had better not be attempted, perhaps.	41	683	148	saying	decidedly	f	f	f	f
6208	You have not been long enough in Bath to enjoy the evening parties of the place.	47	683	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6209	Oh! no. The usual character of them has nothing for me. I am no card-player.	49	683	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6210	You were not formerly, I know. You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes.	51	683	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6211	I am not yet so much changed.	53	683	148	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6212	It is a period, indeed! Eight years and a half is a period.	55	683	155	said	as if it were the result of immediate feeling	f	f	f	f
6213	Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody! I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.	5	684	150	whispered	very audibly	f	f	f	f
6257	You should have distinguished. You should not have suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different. If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk. When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here. In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.	21	689	148	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6214	Oh! dear! very true. Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street. I was never more astonished. He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard. He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return. He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow. He was full of 'to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.	15	685	147	exclaimed	with a very tolerable imitation of nature	f	f	f	f
6215	We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you will give me materials.	7	686	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6216	And so, ma'am, all these thing considered, though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them. At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.	13	686	156	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6217	That is precisely what I was going to observe. I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement. I always think that no mutual--	15	686	152	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6218	Oh! dear Mrs Croft, there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement. It is what I always protested against for my children. It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--	17	686	156	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6219	Yes, dear ma'am, or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long. To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.	19	686	152	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6220	Look here, do you know who that is?	27	686	161	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6221	Certainly: Captain Benwick.	29	686	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6222	Yes, and you may guess who it is for. But it was not done for her. Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him? I little thought then--but no matter. This was drawn at the Cape. He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another! It was a commission to me! But who else was there to employ? I hope I can allow for him. I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another. He undertakes it; he is writing about it now.	31	686	161	\N	in a deep tone	f	f	f	f
6223	Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!	32	686	161	adding	\N	f	f	f	f
6224	No. That I can easily believe.	34	686	148	replied	in a low, feeling voice	f	f	f	f
6225	It was not in her nature. She doted on him.	36	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6227	Yes. We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.	40	686	148	answered	\N	f	f	f	f
6228	Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to Benwick. He has not been forced upon any exertion. The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since.	42	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6229	True, very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we say now, Captain Harville? If the change be not from outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.	44	686	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6230	No, no, it is not man's nature. I will not allow it to be more man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved. I believe the reverse. I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.	46	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6231	Your feelings may be the strongest, but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments. Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise. You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with. You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship. Your home, country, friends, all quitted. Neither time, nor health, nor life, to be called your own. It would be hard, indeed, if woman's feelings were to be added to all this.	48	686	148	replied	with a faltering voice	f	f	f	f
6232	We shall never agree upon this question.	50	686	161	say	\N	f	f	f	f
6233	Have you finished your letter?	52	686	161	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6234	Not quite, a few lines more. I shall have done in five minutes.	54	686	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6235	There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am in very good anchorage here well supplied, and want for nothing. No hurry for a signal at all. Well, Miss Elliot, as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point. No man and woman, would, probably. But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and verse. If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.	56	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6236	Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.	58	686	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6237	But how shall we prove anything?	60	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6239	Ah!, if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows whether we ever meet again!' And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still! If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence! I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!	64	686	161	cried	in a tone of strong feeling	f	f	f	f
6240	Oh!, I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you, and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman. No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives. I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have an object. I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you. All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.	66	686	148	cried	eagerly	f	f	f	f
6241	You are a good soul. There is no quarrelling with you. And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.	70	686	161	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6242	Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe. I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend. To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party. We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?	74	686	152	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6243	Yes, very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a minute. I know you will not be sorry to be off. I shall be at your service in half a minute.	78	686	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6244	Good morning, God bless you!	80	686	161	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6245	By all means, my dear, go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening. I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself. Charles, ring and order a chair. She must not walk.	5	687	156	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6246	I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood. Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening. I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.	11	687	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6247	Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word. Captain Harville has no thought but of going.	13	687	156	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6248	Do you think so? But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry. Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again? You will see them both this morning, I dare say. Do promise me.	15	687	148	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6249	To be sure I will, if you wish it. Charles, if you see Captain Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message. But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy. Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.	17	687	156	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6252	Are you going as high as Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place? Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door. She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place. He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance. By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day round Winthrop.	11	688	154	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6253	I found that I was considered by Harville an engaged man! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she wished it. I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.	5	689	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6254	I was six weeks with Edward and saw him happy. I could have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.	9	689	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6255	Here ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something. But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful. Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was. Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope? You were single. It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine. I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this for me?'	15	689	155	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6256	To see you in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared? How could I look on without agony? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--was it not all against me?	19	689	155	cried	\N	f	f	f	f
6258	Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus, but I could not. I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character. I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year. I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me. I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery. I had no reason to believe her of less authority now. The force of habit was to be added.	23	689	155	replied	\N	f	f	f	f
6259	I should have thought that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.	25	689	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6260	No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give. I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again. My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.	27	689	155	\N	\N	f	f	f	f
6261	I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now. To me, she was in the place of a parent. Do not mistake me, however. I am not saying that she did not err in her advice. It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice. But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience. I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.	5	690	148	said	\N	f	f	f	f
6262	Not yet. But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time. I trust to being in charity with her soon. But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady? My own self. Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter? Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?	9	690	155	replied	as if in cool deliberation	f	f	f	f
6263	Would I!	11	690	148	answer	\N	f	f	f	f
6264	Good God!, you would! It is not that I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again. I did not understand you. I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself. Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared. It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me. I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards. Like other great men under reverses. I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune. I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.	13	690	155	cried/added	with a smile	f	f	f	f

3256	2021-07-26 17:15:35.217359-04	2709	Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspe	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3257	2021-07-26 17:15:40.84828-04	2710	And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s preference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very decided.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

3855	2021-09-07 16:12:55.407939-04	3227	No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

3858	2021-09-07 16:13:16.452771-04	3230	Then pray stay at Richmond.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3859	2021-09-07 16:13:23.181725-04	3231	But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3860	2021-09-07 16:13:30.927461-04	3232	These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

3863	2021-09-07 16:26:19.40363-04	3234	How much I am obliged to you, for telling me to come to-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3864	2021-09-07 16:26:25.339882-04	3235	Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be com	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3865	2021-09-07 16:26:31.363529-04	3236	Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3866	2021-09-07 16:26:36.123165-04	3237	It is hotter to-day.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3867	2021-09-07 16:26:41.0856-04	3238	Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3868	2021-09-07 16:26:49.302642-04	3239	You are comfortable because you are under command.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3869	2021-09-07 16:26:56.233654-04	3240	Your command?—Yes.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3870	2021-09-07 16:27:02.397874-04	3241	Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3871	2021-09-07 16:27:08.058705-04	3242	It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are always with me.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3872	2021-09-07 16:27:13.316812-04	3243	Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3873	2021-09-07 16:27:18.620235-04	3244	Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you first in February.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3874	2021-09-07 16:27:37.062979-04	3245	Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But—nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3875	2021-09-07 16:27:57.141947-04	3246	I say nothing of which I am ashamed. I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on the other. I saw you fir	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

3879	2021-09-07 16:29:01.942507-04	3250	It is a sort of thing, which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party—I never was in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3880	2021-09-07 16:29:14.004334-04	3251	Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body knows what is due to you.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3881	2021-09-07 16:29:29.280607-04	3252	It will not do; they are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3882	2021-09-07 16:29:53.146868-04	3253	Oh! very well, then I need not be uneasy. ‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan’t I? (look	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3883	2021-09-07 16:30:00.529233-04	3254	Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be limited as to number—only three at once.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3884	2021-09-07 16:30:37.22394-04	3255	Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3885	2021-09-07 16:30:52.250211-04	3256	I like your plan. Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3886	2021-09-07 16:31:03.739948-04	3257	Low, I am afraid, sir, very low; but we shall be indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3887	2021-09-07 16:31:15.445226-04	3258	No, no, it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr. Weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me hear it.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3888	2021-09-07 16:31:27.956218-04	3259	I doubt its being very clever myself. It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3889	2021-09-07 16:31:35.659375-04	3260	What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

3891	2021-09-07 16:32:07.661407-04	3262	This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else. Perfection should not have come quite so soon.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3892	2021-09-07 16:32:42.575173-04	3263	Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused; I really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased with.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3893	2021-09-07 16:33:03.81765-04	3264	Yes, yes, pray pass me; I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
3894	2021-09-07 16:33:12.017042-04	3265	With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

7039	2022-06-14 16:57:53.879248-04	5983	I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there. I declare, Anne, he never talks of you at all.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

7041	2022-06-14 16:58:25.386787-04	5985	And I am sure it was a very little to his credit, if he did. Miss Harville only died last June. Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell? I am sure you will agree with me.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

7048	2022-06-14 16:59:49.290882-04	5992	There we differ, Mary. I think Lady Russell would like him. I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
7049	2022-06-14 17:00:02.755716-04	5993	So do I, Anne. I am sure Lady Russell would like him. He is just Lady Russell's sort. Give him a book, and he will read all day long.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
7050	2022-06-14 17:00:57.847974-04	5994	Yes, that he will! He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drops one's scissors, or anything that happens. Do you think Lady Russell would like that?	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

7053	2022-06-14 17:01:41.533878-04	5997	He is a man whom I have no wish to see. His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2

7058	2022-06-14 17:10:17.487465-04	6000	Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental. In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.	1	[{"added": {}}]	13	2
